<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p>March had come in like a lion, raging, turbulent.
Throughout the day the wind had torn spitefully
at the yet bare branches of the great elms in the
park; it had rushed in insensate fury round the
walls of the big grey house; it had driven the rain
lashing against the windows. It had sent the
few remaining leaves of the old year scudding up
the drive; it had littered the lawns with fragments
of broken twigs; it had beaten yellow and purple
crocuses prostrate to the brown earth.</p>
<p>Against the distant rocky coast the sea had
boomed like the muffled thunder of guns; it had
flung itself upon the beach, dragging the stones
back with it in each receding wave, their grinding
adding to the crash of the waters. Nature had
been in her wildest mood, a thing of mad fury.</p>
<p>With sundown a calm had fallen. The wind,
tired of its onslaught, had sunk suddenly to rest.
Only the sea beat and moaned sullenly against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
cliffs, as if unwilling to subdue its anger. Yet,
for all that, a note of fatigue had entered its
voice.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>An old man was sitting in the library of the big
grey house. A shaded reading lamp stood on a
small table near his elbow. The light was thrown
upon an open book lying near it, and on the carved
arms of the oak chair in which the man was sitting.
It shone clearly on his bloodless old hands, on his
parchment-like face, and white hair. A log fire
was burning in a great open hearth on his right.
For the rest, the room was a place of shadows,
deepening to gloom in the distant corners, a gloom
emphasized by the one small circle of brilliant light,
and the red glow of the fire. Book-cases reached
from floor to ceiling the whole length of two walls,
and between the three thickly curtained windows
of the third. In the fourth wall were the fireplace
and the door.</p>
<p>There was no sound to break the silence. The
figure in the oak chair sat motionless. He might
have been carved out of stone, for any sign of life
he gave. He looked like stone,&mdash;white and black
marble very finely sculptured,&mdash;white marble in
head and hands, black marble in the piercing eyes,
the long satin dressing-gown, the oak of the big
chair. Even his eyes seemed stone-like, motionless,
and fixed thoughtfully on space.</p>
<p>To those perceptive of &#8220;atmosphere&#8221; there is
a subtle difference in silence. There is the silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
of woods, the silence of plains, the silence of death,
the silence of sleep, and the silence of wakefulness.
This silence was the last named. It was a silence
alert, alive, yet very still.</p>
<p>A slight movement in the room, so slight as to
be almost imperceptible, roused him to the present.
Life sprang to his eyes, puzzled, questioning; his
body motionless, they turned towards the middle
window of the three, from whence the movement
appeared to have come. It was not repeated.
The old utter silence lay upon the place;
yet Nicholas Danver kept his eyes upon the
curtain.</p>
<p>The minutes passed. Then once more came
that almost imperceptible movement.</p>
<p>Nicholas Danver&#8217;s well-bred old voice broke
the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not come into the room?&#8221; it suggested
quietly. There was a gleam of ironical humour
in his eyes.</p>
<p>The curtains swung apart, and a man came from
between them. He stood blinking towards the
light.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know I was there, sir?&#8221; came the
gruff inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Nicholas, accurately
truthful. &#8220;I merely guessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Nicholas watching the man keenly.
&#8220;By the way, I suppose you know I am entirely
at your mercy. I could ring this bell,&#8221; he indicated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
an electric button attached to the arm of his
chair, &#8220;but I suppose it would be at least three
minutes before any one came. Yes,&#8221; he continued
thoughtfully, &#8220;allowing for the distance
from the servants&#8217; quarters, I should say it would
be at least three minutes. You could get through
a fair amount of business in three minutes. Was it
the candlesticks you wanted?&#8221; He looked towards
a pair of solid silver candlesticks on the
mantelpiece. &#8220;They are cumbersome, you know.
Or the miniatures? There are three Cosways
and four Engleharts. I should recommend the
miniatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to see you,&#8221; said the man bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; Nicholas&#8217;s white eyebrows rose the
fraction of an inch above his keen old eyes. &#8220;An
unusual hour for a visit, and&mdash;an unusual entrance,
if I might make the suggestion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;d never have been a chance of seeing you
if I had come any other way.&#8221; There was a hint
of bitterness in the words.</p>
<p>Nicholas looked straight at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Job Grantley,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I live down
by the Lower Acre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! One of my tenants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, one of your tenants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;?&#8221; suggested Nicholas urbanely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to turn out of my cottage to-morrow,&#8221;
said the man briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; The pupils of Nicholas&#8217;s eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
contracted. &#8220;May I ask why that information
should be of interest to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s of no interest to you, sir, and we know it.
You never hear a word of what happens outside
this house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spencer Curtis conducts my business,&#8221;
said Nicholas politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that too, sir, and we know the way it
is conducted. It&#8217;s an iron hand, and a heart like
flint. It&#8217;s pay or go, and not an hour&#8217;s grace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can hardly expect him to give you my
cottages rent free,&#8221; suggested Nicholas suavely.</p>
<p>The man winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. But where a few weeks would make
all the difference to a man, where it&#8217;s a matter of
a few shillings standing between home and the
roadside&mdash;&#8221; he broke off.</p>
<p>Nicholas was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps a word to you, sir,&#8221; went on
the man half wistfully. &#8220;We&#8217;re to go to-morrow
if I can&#8217;t pay, and I can&#8217;t. A couple of weeks
might have made all the difference. It was for the
wife I came, sneaking up here like a thief. She&#8217;s
lost two little ones; they never but opened their
eyes on the world to shut them again. I&#8217;m glad
on it now. But women aren&#8217;t made that way.
There&#8217;s another coming. She&#8217;s not strong. I
doubt but the shock&#8217;ll not take her and the little
one too. Better for them both if it does. A man
can face odds, and remake his life if he is a man&mdash;&#8221;
he stopped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>Still there was silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a fool to come,&#8221; said the man drearily.
&#8220;&#8217;Twas the weather did it in the end. I&#8217;d gone
mad-like listening to the wind and rain, and thinking
of her and the child that was to be&mdash;&#8221; again
he stopped.</p>
<p>Nicholas was watching him from under the penthouse
of his eyebrows. Suddenly he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon could you pay your rent?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a fortnight most like, sir. Three weeks for
certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you told Mr. Curtis that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, sir. But it&#8217;s the tick of time, or out
you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been behindhand before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How has it happened now?&#8221; The questions
came short, incisive.</p>
<p>The man flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How has it happened now?&#8221; repeated Nicholas
distinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lent a bit, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Widow Thisby. She&#8217;s an old woman, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me the whole story,&#8221; said Nicholas
curtly.</p>
<p>Again the flush rose to the man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her son got into a bit of trouble, sir. It was
a matter of a sovereign or going to gaol. He&#8217;s only
a youngster, and the prison smell sticks. Trust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
folk for nosing it out. He&#8217;s got a chance now, and
will be sending his mother a trifle presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose she&#8217;ll repay you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Job fidgeted with his cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I don&#8217;t suppose it&#8217;ll be more&#8217;n a
trifle he&#8217;ll send; and she&#8217;s got her work cut out
to make both ends meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose you <i>gave</i> her the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Job shifted his feet uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you intend to raise the money due for
your rent, then?&#8221; demanded Nicholas less curtly.</p>
<p>Job left off fidgeting. He felt on safer ground
here.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just meant a bit extra saved from each
week,&#8221; he said eagerly. &#8220;You can do it if you&#8217;ve
time. Boiling water poured into the morning teapot
for evenings, and knock off your bit of bacon,
and&mdash;well, there&#8217;s lots of ways, sir, and women is
wonderful folk for managing, the best ones.
Where it&#8217;s thought and trouble they&#8217;ll do it, and
they&#8217;d be using strength too if they&#8217;d got it, but
some of them hasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; said Nicholas. He put up his hand to
his mouth. &#8220;So you <i>gave</i> money you knew would
never be repaid, knowing, too, that it meant possible
homelessness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have done it yourself if you&#8217;d been in
my place,&#8221; said the man bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I?&#8221; said Nicholas half ironically. &#8220;I
very much doubt it. Also what right had you to
gamble with your wife&#8217;s happiness? You knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
the risk you ran. You knew the&mdash;er, the rule
regarding the rents. Job Grantley, you were a
fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the colour rushed to the man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;May be, sir. I&#8217;ll allow it sounds foolishness,
but&mdash;oh Lord, sir, where&#8217;s the use o&#8217; back-thinking
now. I reckon you&#8217;d never do a hand&#8217;s turn for
nobody if you spent your time looking backward
and forrard at your jobs.&#8221; He stopped, his chin
quivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Job Grantley, you were a fool.&#8221; Nicholas
repeated the words with even deliberation.</p>
<p>The man moved silently towards the window.
There was a clumsy dignity about his figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; said Nicholas. &#8220;Job Grantley, you
<i>are</i> a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man turned round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to that drawer,&#8221; ordered Nicholas, &#8220;and
bring me a pocket-book you will find there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mechanically the man did as he was bidden.
Nicholas took the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; he said opening it, &#8220;how much
will put you right?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;oh, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much will put you right?&#8221; demanded
Nicholas.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pound, sir. The month&#8217;s rent is due
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph. Not much to stand between you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
and&mdash;hell. I&#8217;ve no doubt you did consider it
hell. We each have our own interpretation of that
cheerful abode.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned the papers carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look here,&#8221; he said suddenly, &#8220;there&#8217;s
five pounds. It&#8217;s for yourselves, mind. No more
indiscriminate bestowal of charity, you understand.
You begin your charity at home. Do you follow
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man took the money in a dazed fashion.
He was more than half bewildered at the sudden
turn in events.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll repay you faithfully, sir. I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you,&#8221; broke in Nicholas softly, &#8220;who
talked about repayment? Can&#8217;t I make a present
as well as you, if I like? Besides I owe you
something for this ten minutes. They have been
interesting. I don&#8217;t get too many excitements.
That&#8217;ll do. I don&#8217;t want any thanks. Be off
with you. Better go by the window. There
might be a need of explanations if you tried a more
conventional mode of exit now. That&#8217;ll do, that&#8217;ll
do. Go, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two minutes later Nicholas was looking again
towards the curtains behind which Job Grantley
had vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, was I the greater fool?&#8221; he said aloud.
There was an odd, mocking expression in his eyes.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Ten minutes later he pressed the electric button
attached to the arm of his chair. His eyes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
on his watch which he held in his hand. As
the library door opened, he replaced it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right to the second,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Ah,
Jessop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who entered was about fifty years of
age, or thereabouts, grey-haired, clean-shaven.
His face was cast in the rigid lines peculiar to his
calling. Possibly they relaxed when with his own
kind, but one could not feel certain of the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Jessop, do you know Job Grantley by
sight?&#8221;</p>
<p>For one brief second Jessop stared, amazement
fallen upon him. Then the mask of impenetrability
was on again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Job Grantley, yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is he like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tallish man, sir; wears corduroys. Dark
hair and eyes; looks straight at you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. Very good. Perhaps I wasn&#8217;t a fool,&#8221;
he was thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Mr. Curtis?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; This came very shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should you call him&mdash;er, a hard man?&#8221; asked
Nicholas smoothly.</p>
<p>Again amazement fell on Jessop&#8217;s soul, revealing
itself momentarily in his features. And again the
amazement was concealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good business man, sir,&#8221; came the
cautious reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;?&#8221; suggested Nicholas.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A good business man isn&#8217;t ordinarily what
you&#8217;d call tender-like,&#8221; said Jessop grimly.</p>
<p>Nicholas flashed a glance of amusement at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; he replied dryly.</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the tenants ever ask to see me?&#8221; demanded
Nicholas.</p>
<p>&#8220;They used to, sir. Now they save their shoe-leather
coming up the drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you told them&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your orders, sir. You saw no one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221; Nicholas&#8217;s fingers were beating a light
tattoo on the arm of his chair. &#8220;Well, those are
my orders. That will do. You needn&#8217;t come
again till I ring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessop turned towards the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way,&#8221; Nicholas&#8217;s voice arrested him
on the threshold, &#8220;I fancy the middle window is
unlatched.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessop returned and went behind the curtains.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Nicholas as he
emerged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessop left the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now how on earth did he know that?&#8221; he
queried as he walked across the hall.</p>
<p>The curtains had been drawn when Nicholas had
been carried into the room. The knowledge, for a
man unable to move from his chair, seemed little
short of uncanny.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>A man can face odds if he is a man, and remake
his life.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The words repeated themselves in Nicholas&#8217;s
brain. Each syllable was like the incisive tap
of a hammer. They fell on a wound lately
dealt.</p>
<p>A little scene, barely ten days old, reconstructed
itself in his memory. The stage was the one he
now occupied; the position the same. But another
actor was present, a big rugged man, clad
in a shabby overcoat,&mdash;a man with keen eyes,
a grim mouth, and flexible sensitive hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I regret to tell you that, humanly speaking,
you have no more than a year to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man had looked past him as he spoke the
words. He had had his back to the light, but
Nicholas had seen something almost inscrutable
in his expression.</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s voice had followed close upon the
words, politely ironical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally I should have considered it a
matter for congratulation rather than regret,&#8221;
he had suggested.</p>
<p>There had been the fraction of a pause. Then
the man&#8217;s voice had broken the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. What has my life been for fifteen years?&#8221;
Nicholas had demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you have made of it,&#8221; had been the
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What God or the devil has made of it, aided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
by Baccarat&mdash;poor beast,&#8221; Nicholas had retorted
savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil, possibly,&#8221; the man had replied,
&#8220;but aided and abetted by yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound you, what are you talking about?&#8221;
Nicholas had cried.</p>
<p>The man had still looked towards the book-cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he had said. &#8220;For fifteen years you
have lived the life of a recluse&mdash;a useless recluse,
mind you. And why? Because of pride,&mdash;sheer
pride. Those who had known you in the strength
of your manhood, those who had known you as
Nick the dare-devil, should never see the broken
cripple. Pride forbade it. You preferred to run
to cover, to lie hidden there like a wounded beast,
rather than face, like a man, the odds that were
against you,&mdash;heavy odds, I&#8217;ll allow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s eyes had blazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; he had shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a year left,&#8221; went on the man calmly.
&#8220;I should advise you to see what use you can
make of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first use I&#8217;ll make of it is to order you from
the house. You can go at once.&#8221; Nicholas had
pointed towards the door.</p>
<p>The man had got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he had said, looking at him for the
first time in the last ten minutes. &#8220;But don&#8217;t
forget. You&#8217;ve got the year, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To hell with the year,&#8221; said Nicholas curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn the fellow,&#8221; he had said as the door had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
closed behind him. But the very truth of the
words had left a wound,&mdash;a clean-cut wound
however. There was never any bungling where
Doctor Hilary was concerned.</p>
<p>And now incisive, sharp, came the taps of the
hammer on it, taps dealt by Job Grantley&#8217;s chance
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound both the men,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;But
the fellow deserved the five pounds. It was the
first interest I&#8217;ve had for fifteen years. The kind
of entrance I&#8217;d have made myself, too; or perhaps
mine would have been even a bit more unusual,
eh, Nick the dare-devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the old name again. He had never
earned it through the least malice, however. Fool-hardiness
perhaps, added to indomitable high
spirits and good health, but malice, never.</p>
<p>How Father O&#8217;Brady had chuckled over the
prank that had first earned him the title,&mdash;the
holding up of the coach that ran between Byestry
and Kingsleigh, Nick at the head of a band of half
a dozen young scapegraces clad in black masks and
huge hats, and armed with old pistols purloined
from the historic gun-room of the old Hall! It had
been a leaf from the book of Claude Duval with a
slight difference.</p>
<p>Nick had re-acted the scene for him. He was
an inimitable mimic. He had taken off old Lady
Fanshawe&#8217;s cackling fright to the life. As the
stoutest and oldest dowager of the lot he had
obliged her to dance a minuet with him, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
terrified coachman, postilion, and solitary male
passenger covered by his companions&#8217; pistols the
while. The fluttered younger occupants of the
coach had frankly envied the terrified dowager,
yet Nick had bestowed but the most perfunctory
of glances upon them, and that for a reason best
known to himself.</p>
<p>Later the truth of the affair had leaked out, and
Lady Fanshawe could never chaperon one of her
numerous nieces to a ball, without being besieged
by young men imploring the favour of a dance.
Being a sporting old lady&mdash;when not out of her
wits with terror&mdash;she had taken it all in good part.
Once, even, she had danced the very same minuet
with Nick, the whole ballroom looking on and
applauding.</p>
<p>It had been the first of a series of pranks each
madder than the last, but each equally light-hearted
and gay.</p>
<p>That is till Cecilia Lester married Basil Percy.</p>
<p>The world, namely the small circle in which
Cecilia and Nick moved, had heard of the marriage
with amazement. If Nick was amazed he did not
show it, but his pranks held less of gaiety, more of
a grim foolhardiness. Father O&#8217;Brady no longer
chuckled over their recitation. Maybe because
they mainly reached his ears from outside sources.
Nick, who was not of his fold, seldom sought his
society in these days. Later he heard them not at
all, being removed to another mission.</p>
<p>And then, at last, came the day when Nick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
played his final prank in the hunting field,&mdash;his
maddest prank, in which Baccarat failed him. The
horse was shot where he lay. His rider was carried
home half dead; and half dead, literally, he
had been for fifteen years.</p>
<p>And there was yet one more year left to him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Nicholas sat gazing at the fire.</p>
<p>His brain was extraordinarily alert. There
was a dawning humour waking in his eyes, a hint
of the bygone years&#8217; devil-may-careness. The
old Nick was stirring within him, roused by the
little blows of that sentence.</p>
<p>Suddenly a flash of laughter illuminated his
whole face. He brought his hand down on the
arm of his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;By gad, I&#8217;ve got it, and Hilary&#8217;s the man to
help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Nicholas to forget his
own share in that little ten-day-old scene. Also
it may be safely averred that Doctor Hilary would
be equally forgetful.</p>
<p>Nicholas still sat gazing into the fire, chuckling
every now and then to himself. It was midnight
before he rang for Jessop. The ringing had been
preceded by one short sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;By gad, Nick the dare-devil, the scheme&#8217;s
worthy of the old days.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE LETTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Antony was sitting on the stoep of his bungalow.
The African sun was bathing the landscape in a
golden glory. Before him lay his garden, a medley
of brilliant colour. Just beyond it was a field of
green Indian corn, scintillating to silver as a little
breeze swept its surface. Beyond it again lay the
vineyard, and the thatched roof of an old Dutch
farmhouse half hidden among trees. Farther off
still rose the mountains, golden in the sunlight.</p>
<p>It was the middle of the afternoon. Silence
reigned around, broken only by the occasional
chirp of a grasshopper, the muffled note of a frog,
the twitter of the canaries among the cosmos, or
the rustle of the reed curtain which veiled the end
of the stoep.</p>
<p>The reed curtain veiled the bathroom, a primitive
affair, the bath consisting of half an old wine
vat, filled with velvety mountain water, conducted
thither by means of a piece of hose-piping attached
to the solitary water tap the estate possessed. It
was emptied by means of a bung fixed in the lower
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
part of the vat, the water affording irrigation for
the garden.</p>
<p>Antony sat very still. His coat lay beside him
on the stoep. A small wire-haired puppy named
Josephus mounted guard upon it. Woe betide
the person other than Antony&#8217;s self who ventured
to lay finger on the garment. There would be a
bristling of short wiry white hair, a showing of baby
white teeth, and a series of almost incredibly vicious
growls. Josephus permitted no man to take
liberties with his master&#8217;s property, nor indeed
with his ridiculously dignified small self. Antony
was the sole exception to his rule. But then was
not he a king among men, a person whose word was
law, whose caress a benediction, whose blow a
thing for which to demand mute pardon? You
knew it was deserved, though the knowledge might
possibly at times be vague, since your wisdom was
as yet but puppy wisdom.</p>
<p>Now and again Josephus hung out a pink tongue,
a tongue which demanded milk in a saucer. He
knew tea-time to the second,&mdash;ordinarily speaking
that is to say. He could not accustom himself to
that extra half-hour&#8217;s delay which occurred on mail
days, a delay caused by Riffle, the coloured boy,
having to walk to the village to fetch the post.
The walk was seldom entirely fruitless. Generally
there was a newspaper of sorts; occasionally&mdash;very
occasionally&mdash;a letter. Josephus knew
that the click of the garden gate heralded the
swift arrival of tea, but it was not always easy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
to realize on which days that click was to be
expected.</p>
<p>Antony gazed at the scintillating field of corn.
The sight pleased him. There is always a glory
in creation, even if it be creation by proxy, so to
speak. At all events he had been the human agent
in the matter. He had ploughed the brown earth;
he had cast the yellow seed, trudging the furrows
with swinging arm; he had dug the little trenches
through which the limpid mountain water should
flow to the parched earth; he had watched the
first hint of green spreading like a light veil; he
had seen it thicken, carpeting the field; and now
he saw the full fruit of his labours. Strong and
healthy it stood before him, the soft wind rippling
across its surface, silvering the green.</p>
<p>The click of the garden gate roused him from
his contemplation. Josephus cocked one ear, his
small body pleasurably alert.</p>
<p>Antony turned his head. Mail day always held
possibilities, however improbable, an expectation
unknown to those to whom the sound of the postman&#8217;s
knock comes in the ordinary course of events.
Riffle appeared round the corner of the stoep.
Had you seen him anywhere but in Africa, you
would have vowed he was a good-looking
Italian. A Cape coloured boy he was truly,
and that, mark you, is a very different thing
from Kaffir.</p>
<p>&#8220;The paper, master, and a letter,&#8221; he announced
with some importance. Then he disappeared to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
prepare the tea for which Josephus&#8217;s doggy soul
was longing.</p>
<p>Antony turned the letter in his hands. It must
be confessed it was a disappointment. It was
obviously a business communication. Both envelope
and clerkly writing made that fact apparent.
It was a drop to earth after the first leap of joy
that had heralded Riffle&#8217;s announcement. It was
like putting out your hand to greet a friend, and
meeting&mdash;a commercial traveller.</p>
<p>Antony smiled ruefully. Yet, after all, it was
an English commercial traveller. That fact stood
for something. It was, at all events, a faint breath
of the Old Country. In England the letter had
been penned, in England it had been posted, from
England it had come to him. Yet who on earth
had business affairs to communicate to him!</p>
<p>He broke the seal.</p>
<p>Amazement fell upon him with the first words
he read. By the end of the perusal his brain
was whirling. It was incredible, astounding. He
stared out into the sunshine. Surely he was
dreaming. It must be a joke of sorts, a laughable
hoax. Yet there was no hint of joking in the
concise communication, in the small clerkly handwriting,
in the business-like letter-paper, a letter-paper
headed by the name of a most respectable
firm of solicitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m jiggered,&#8221; declared Antony to the
sunshine. And he fell to a second perusal of the
letter. Here is what he read:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p>And the paper was headed, Parsons &amp; Glieve,
Solicitors.</p>
<p>Nicholas Danver. Where had he heard that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
name before? What faint cord of memory did
it strike? He sought in vain for the answer. Yet
somehow, at sometime, surely he had heard it!
Again and again he seemed on the verge of discovering
the clue, and again and again it escaped
him, slipping elusive from him. It was tantalizing,
annoying. With a slight mental effort he abandoned
the search. Unpursued, the clue might
presently return to him.</p>
<p>Riffle reappeared on the stoep bearing a tea-tray.
Josephus sat erect. For full ten minutes
his brown eyes gazed ardently towards the table.
What had happened? What untoward event had
occurred? Antony was oblivious of his very existence.
Munching bread and butter, drinking hot
tea himself, he appeared entirely to have forgotten
that a thirsty and bewilderedly disappointed puppy
was gazing at him from the harbourage of his old
coat. At length the neglect became a thing not
to be borne. Waving a deprecating paw, Josephus
gave vent to a pitiful whine.</p>
<p>Antony turned. Then realization dawned on
him. He grasped the milk jug.</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor little beggar,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not often you get neglected. But it&#8217;s not often
that bombshells in the shape of ordinary, simple,
harmless-looking letters fall from the skies, scattering
extraordinary contents and my wits along
with them. Here you are, you morsel of injured
patience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Josephus lapped, greedily, thirstily, till the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
empty saucer circled on the stoep under the
onslaughts of his small pink tongue.</p>
<p>Antony had again sunk into a reverie, a reverie
which lasted for another fifteen minutes or so.
At last he roused himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Josephus, my son,&#8221; he announced solemnly,
&#8220;there are jobs to be done, and in spite of bombshells
we&#8217;d better do them, and leave Arabian
Night wonders for further contemplation this
evening.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>MEMORIES</h3>
</div>

<p>Some four hours later, Antony, once more in his
deck-chair on the stoep, set himself to review
the situation. Shorn of its first bewilderment it
resolved itself into the fact that he, Antony Gray,
owner of a small farm on the African veldt, which
farm brought him in a couple of hundred a year or
thereabouts, was about to become the proprietor of
an estate valued at a yearly income of twelve
thousand,&mdash;subject, however, to certain conditions.
And in that last clause lay the possible fly in the
ointment. What conditions?</p>
<p>Antony turned the possibilities in his mind.</p>
<p>Matrimony with some lady of Nicholas Danver&#8217;s
own choosing? He dismissed the idea. It
savoured too much of early Victorian melodrama
for the prosaic twentieth century. The support of
some antediluvian servant or pet? Possibly. But
then it would hardly be necessary to require verbal
communication of such a condition; a brief written
statement to the effect would have sufficed. The
house ghost-haunted; a yearly exorcising of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
restless spirit demanded? Again too melodramatic.
A promise to live on the estate, and on the estate
alone? Far more probable.</p>
<p>Well, he&#8217;d give that fast enough. The veldt-desire
had never gripped him as it is declared to
grip those who have found a home in Africa.
Behind the splendour, the pageantry, the vastness,
he had always felt a hint of something sinister,
something cruel; a spirit, perhaps of evil, ever
wakeful, ever watching. Now and again a sound,
a scent would make him sick with longing, with
longing for an English meadow, for the clean
breath of new-mown hay, for the fragrance of June
roses, for the song of the thrush, and the sweet
piping of the blackbird.</p>
<p>He had crushed down the longing as sentimental.
Having set out on a path he would walk it, till
such time as Fate should clearly indicate another
signpost. He saw her finger now, and welcomed
the direction of its pointing. At all events he
might make venture of the new route,&mdash;an Arabian
Night&#8217;s path truly, gold-paved, mysterious. If,
after making some steps along it, he should discover
a barrier other than he had a mind to surmount,
he could always return to the old road.
Fate might point, but she should never push him
against his will. Thus he argued, confident within
his soul. He had the optimism, the trust of youth
to his balance. He had not yet learned the deepest
of Fate&#8217;s subtleties, the apparent candour which
conceals her tricks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>He gazed out into the night, ruminative, speculative.
The breeze which had rippled across the
Indian corn during the day had sunk to rest. The
darkened field lay tranquil under the stars big and
luminous. From far across the veldt came the
occasional beating of a buzzard&#8217;s wings, like the
beating of muffled drums. A patch of gum trees
to the right, beyond the garden, stood out black
against the sky.</p>
<p>Nicholas Danver. The name repeated itself
within his brain, and then, with it, came a sudden
flash of lucid memory lighting up a long forgotten
scene.</p>
<p>He saw a small boy, a very small boy, tugging,
pulling, and twisting at a tough gorse stick on a
moorland. He felt the clenching of small teeth,
the bruised ache of small hands, the heat of the
small body, the obstinate determination of soul.
A slight sound had caused the boy to turn, and he
had seen a man on a big black horse, watching him
with laughing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never break that,&#8221; the man had
remarked amused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to. I&#8217;ve begun,&#8221; had been the small
boy&#8217;s retort. And he had returned to the onslaught,
regardless of the watching man.</p>
<p>Ten minutes had ended in an exceedingly heated
triumph. The boy had sunk upon the grass,
sucking a wounded finger. The mood of determination
had passed with the victory. He had
been too shy to look at the rider on the black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
horse. But the gorse stick had lain on the
ground beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake hands,&#8221; the man had said.</p>
<p>And the boy had scrambled to his feet to extend
a grubby paw.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; the man had demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony Gray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Richard Gray&#8217;s son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man had burst into a shout of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, tell him his son is a chip of the old block,
and Nicholas Danver says so. Ask him if he
remembers the coach road from Byestry to Kingsleigh.
Good-bye, youngster.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nicholas had ridden away.</p>
<p>It was astonishing in what detail the scene came
back to him. He could smell the hot aromatic
scent of the gorse and wild thyme. He could hear
the humming of the bees above the heather. He
could see the figure on the black horse growing
speck-like in the distance as he had gazed after it.</p>
<p>The whole thing pieced itself together. He
remembered that he had gone to that cottage on
the moorland with his nurse to recover after
measles. He remembered that his father had said
that the air of the place would make a new boy of
him. He remembered his father&#8217;s laugh, when,
later, the tale of the meeting had been recounted
to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Nick,&#8221; he had said. &#8220;One loses
sight of the friends of one&#8217;s boyhood as one grows
older, more&#8217;s the pity. I must write to old Nick.&#8221;</p>
<p>There the incident had closed. Yet clearly as
the day on which it had occurred, a day now
twenty-five years old, it repainted itself on Antony&#8217;s
brain, as he sat on the stoep, gazing out
into the African night.</p>
<p>It never occurred to him to wonder why Nicholas
should have left him his money and property.
That he had done so was marvellous, truly; his
reasons for doing so were not even speculated
upon. Antony had a childlike faculty for accepting
facts as they presented themselves to him, with
wonderment, pleasure, frank disapprobation, or
stoicism, as the case might be. The side issues,
which led to the presentation of the facts, were,
generally speaking, the affair of others rather than
his own; and, as such, were no concern of his. It
was not that he deliberately refused to consider
them, but merely that being no concern of his,
it never occurred to him to do so. He walked his
own route, sometimes singing, sometimes dreaming,
sometimes amusedly silent, and always working.
Work had been of necessity from the day his
father&#8217;s death had summoned him hurriedly from
college. A quixotic, and, it is to be feared, culpable
generosity on Richard Gray&#8217;s part had left
his son penniless.</p>
<p>Antony had accepted the fact stoically, and
even cheerfully. He had looked straight at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
generosity, denying the culpability, thereby preserving
what he valued infinitely more than lands
or gold&mdash;his father&#8217;s memory, thus proving himself
in very truth his son. He had no ties to bind
him; he was an only child, and his mother was long
since dead. He set out on his own route, a route
which had led him far, and finally had landed him,
some five years previously, on the African veldt,
where he had become the owner of the small farm
he now occupied.</p>
<p>After all, there had been compensations in the
life. All unconsciously he had taken for his watch-word
the cry: &#8220;I will succeed in spite of ...&#8221;
rather than the usual old lament: &#8220;I could succeed
if....&#8221; Naturally there had been difficulties.
He had considered them grave-eyed and
silent; he had tackled them smiling and singing.
Inwardly he was the same Antony who had conquered
the gorse-stick on the moorland; outwardly&mdash;well,
he didn&#8217;t make the fight so obvious. That
was all the difference.</p>
<p>And now, sitting on the stoep with the silence
of the African night around him, he tried to shape
his plans, to bring them forth from the glamour of
the marvellous which had enshrouded them, to
marshal them up into coherent everyday form.
But the glamour refused to be dispelled. Everything,
the smallest and most prosaic detail, stood
before him bathed in its light. It was all so
gorgeously unexpected, so&mdash;so stupendously
mysterious.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>And through all the glamour, the unexpectedness,
and the mystery, there was sounding an
ever-repeated chord of music, composed of the
notes of youth, happiness, memory, desire, and
expectation. And, thus combined, they struck
the one word&mdash;England.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>QUOD SCRIPTUM EST</h3>
</div>

<p>The <i>Fort Salisbury</i> was cutting her way through
the translucent green water. Cape Town, with
Table Mountain and the Lion&#8217;s Head beyond it,
was vanishing into the increasing distance.</p>
<p>Antony had taken his passage on the <i>Fort
Salisbury</i> for three reasons: number one, she
was the first boat sailing from Cape Town after he
had dispatched his momentous cablegram; number
two, he had a certain diffidence regarding the expenditure
of other people&#8217;s money, and his passage
on the <i>Fort Salisbury</i> would certainly be
lower than on a mail boat; number three, a curious
and altogether unaccountable impulse had impelled
him to the choice. This reason had, perhaps
unconsciously, weighed with him considerably more
than the other two. He often found instinct throwing
itself into the balance for or against the motives
of mere reason. When it was against mere reason,
matters occasionally complicated themselves in his
mind. It had been a comfort to find, in this case,
reason on the same side of the scale as instinct.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>Antony, leaning on the rail of the upper deck,
was content, blissfully content. The sole speck
that marred his entire enjoyment was the fact
that the rules of the boat had separated him, <i>pro
tem</i>, from an exceedingly perplexed and distressed
puppy. It was the perplexity and distress of the
said puppy that caused the speck, rather than the
separation. Antony, with the vaster wisdom
vouchsafed to humans, knew the present separation
to be of comparatively short duration, and to
be endured in the avoidance of a possibly infinitely
longer one. Not so Josephus. He suffered in
silence, since his deity had commanded the silence,
but the perplexed grief in his puppy heart found
an echo in Antony&#8217;s.</p>
<p>It was a faint echo, however. Time and a daily
visit would bring consolation to Josephus; and,
for himself, the present adventure&mdash;it was an
adventure&mdash;was all-absorbing and delicious. He
revelled in it like a schoolboy on a holiday. He
watched the sparkling water, the tiny rippling
waves; he felt the freshness of the sea breeze, and
the throb of the engine like a great living heart in
the body of the boat. The fact that there were
other people on her decks concerned him not at all.
Those who have travelled a good deal become,
generally speaking, one of two types,&mdash;the type
that is quite enormously interested in everyone,
and the type that is entirely indifferent to any one.
Antony was of this last type. He had acquired a
faculty for shutting his mental, and to a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
degree, his physical eyes to his human fellows,
except in so far as sheer necessity compelled.
Naturally this did not make for popularity; but,
then, Antony did not care much for popularity.
The winning of it would have been too great an
effort for his nature; the retaining of it, even more
strenuous. Of course the whole thing is entirely
a question of temperament.</p>
<p>A few of the other passengers looked somewhat
curiously at the tall lean man gazing out to sea;
but, as he was so obviously oblivious of their very
existence, so entirely absorbed in his contemplation
of the ocean, they left him undisturbed.</p>
<p>It was not till the dressing bugle sounded that
he roused himself, and descended to his cabin.
It was a matter for his fervent thanksgiving that
he had found himself the sole occupant of the
tiny two-berthed apartment.</p>
<p>He arrayed himself with scrupulous care. Only
the most stringent exigencies of time and place&mdash;though
they for a while had been frequent&mdash;had
ever caused him to forego the ceremonial of donning
dress clothes for dinner, though no eyes but
his own should behold him. Latterly there had
been Riffle and then Josephus to behold, and the
former to marvel. Josephus took it, puppy-like,
as a matter of course.</p>
<p>There were not a vast number of passengers on
the boat. Of the four tables in the dining saloon,
Antony found only two fully laid, and a third
partially so. His own place was some three seats
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
from the captain&#8217;s left. The chair on the captain&#8217;s
right was, as yet, unoccupied. For the rest,
with but one or two exceptions at the other tables,
the passengers had already put in an appearance.
The almost entire absence of wind, the smoothness
of the ocean, had given courage even to those
the most susceptible to the sea&#8217;s malady. It would
have required a really vivid imagination to have
perceived any motion in the boat other than the
throbbing of her engines.</p>
<p>Antony slipped into his seat, and a steward
placed a plate of clear soup before him. In the
act of taking his first spoonful, he paused, his eyes
arrested by the sight of a woman advancing
towards the chair on the captain&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>At the first glance, Antony saw that she was a
tall woman, dressed in black unrelieved save for
ruffles of soft creamy lace at her throat and wrists.
Presently he took in further details, the dark
chestnut of her hair, the warm ivory of her skin,
the curious steady gravity of her eyes&mdash;grey or
violet, he was not sure which,&mdash;the straight line
of her eyebrows, the delicate chiselling of her nose,
and the red-rose of her mouth. And yet, in spite
of seeing the details, they were submerged in the
personality which had first arrested him. Something
within him told him as clearly as spoken
words, that here, in her presence, lay the explanation
of the instinct which had prompted him to
take his passage on this boat.</p>
<p>An odd little thrill of unaccountable excitement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
ran through him. He felt like a man who had
been shown a page in his own life-book, and who
found the words written thereon extraordinarily
and amazingly interesting. He found himself
longing, half-inarticulately, to turn the leaf; and,
yet, he knew that Time&#8217;s hand alone could do this.
He could only read as far as the end of the open
page before him. And that page but recorded the
fact of her presence.</p>
<p>Once, during the repast, her eyes met his,
steady, grave, and yet with a little note of half
interrogation in them. Again Antony felt that
odd little thrill run through him, this time intensified,
while his heart beat and pounded under his
immaculate white shirt-front.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a mercy that shirt-fronts, to say
nothing of other things, do hide the vagaries of
our hearts. It would be a sorry thing for us if the
world at large could perceive them,&mdash;the joy, the
anguish, the remorse, and the bitter little disappointments.
Yes, above all, the bitter little disappointments,
the cause possibly so trivial, so
childish almost, yet the hurt, the wound, so very
real, the pain so horribly poignant. It is the little
stab which smarts the most; the blow which accompanies
the deeper wound, numbs in its very
delivery.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Later, in the moonlit darkness, Antony found
himself again on deck, and again leaning by the
rail. Yet this time he had that page from his life-book
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
for company; and, marvelling, he perused
the written words thereon. It was extraordinary
that they should hold such significance for him.
And why for him alone? he queried. Might not
another, others even, have read the selfsame
words?</p>
<p>With the thought came a pang of something
akin to jealousy at his heart. He wanted the
words for himself, written for him alone. And
yet it was entirely obvious, considering the number
at the table, that they must have been recorded for
others also, since, as already mentioned, they but
recorded the fact of her presence. But did they
hold the same significance for the others? There
was the question, and there possibly, nay probably,
lay the comfort. Also, what lay on the other side
of the page? Unanswerable at the moment.</p>
<p>He looked down at the gliding water, alive, alight
with brilliant phosphorus. A step behind him
made his heart leap. He did not turn, but he was
conscious of a figure on his right, also looking down
upon the water. Suddenly there was a faint
flutter of drapery, and the breeze sent a trail of
something soft and silky across his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sorry,&#8221; said a voice in the darkness.</p>
<p>Antony turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind caught it,&#8221; she explained apologetically,
tucking the chiffon streamer within her cloak.</p>
<p>Now, it is quite certain that Antony had here
an opportunity to make one of those little ordinary
pleasant remarks that invariably lead to a conversation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
but none presented itself to his mind.
He could do nothing but utter the merest formal,
though of course polite, acknowledgment of her
apology, his brain seeking wildly for further words
the while. It found none.</p>
<p>She gave him a little bow, courteous and not at
all unfriendly, and moved away across the deck.
Antony looked after her figure receding in the
darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you idiot,&#8221; he groaned within his heart,
&#8220;you utter and double-dyed idiot.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked despairingly down at the water, and
from it to the moonlit sky. Fate, so he mused
ruefully, writes certain sentences in our life-book,
truly; but it behoves each one of us to fill in between
the lines. And he had filled in&mdash;nothing.</p>
<p>An hour or so later he descended dejectedly to
his cabin.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE LADY OF THE BLUE BOOK</h3>
</div>

<p>He saw her at breakfast the next morning; and
again, later, sitting on a deck-chair, with a book.</p>
<p>Once more he cursed his folly of the previous
evening. A word or two then, no matter how
trivial their utterance, and the barriers of convention
would have been passed. Even should Fate
throw a like opportunity in his path again, it was
entirely improbable that she would choose the
same hour. She is ever chary of exact repetitions.
And, if his stammering tongue failed in speech with
the soft darkness to cover its shyness, how was it
likely it would find utterance in the broad light of
day? The Moment&mdash;he spelled it with a capital&mdash;had
passed, and would never again recur. Therefore
he seated himself on his own deck-chair, some
twenty paces from her, and began to fill his pipe,
gloomily enough. Yet, in spite of gloom, he
watched her,&mdash;surreptitiously of course. There
was no ill-bred staring in his survey.</p>
<p>She was again dressed in black, but this time the
lace ruffles had given place to soft white muslin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
cuffs and collar. Her dark hair was covered by a
broad-brimmed black hat. She was leaning back
in her chair as she read, the book lying on her lap.
Suddenly the gravity of her face relaxed. A smile
rippled across it like a little breeze across the surface
of some lake. The smile broke into silent
laughter. Antony found himself smiling in response.</p>
<p>She looked up from her book, and out over the
sun-kissed water, the amusement still trembling
on her lips and dancing in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; reflected Antony watching her,
&#8220;what she has been reading.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some ten minutes she sat gazing at the sunshine.
Then she rose from her chair, placed her
book upon it, and went towards the stairway
which led to the lower deck.</p>
<p>Antony looked at the empty chair&mdash;empty, that
is, except for a pale blue cushion and a deeper blue
book. On the back of the chair, certain letters
were painted,&mdash;P. di D.</p>
<p>Antony surveyed them gravely. The first
letter really engrossed his attention. The last was
merely an adjunct. The first would represent&mdash;or
should represent&mdash;the real woman. He marshalled
every possibility before him, merely to
dismiss them: Patience, Phyllis, Prudence, Priscilla,
Perpetua, Penelope, Persis, Ph&oelig;be, Pauline,&mdash;none
were to his mind. The last appeared to
him the most possible, and yet it did not truly
belong. So he summed up its fitness. Yet, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
the life of him, he could find no other. He had
run through the whole gamut attached to the
initial, so he told himself. Curiosity, or interest,
call it what you will, fell back baffled.</p>
<p>He got up from his chair, and began to pace the
deck. Passing her chair, he gazed again upon the
letters painted thereon, as if challenging them to
disclose the secret. Inscrutable, they stared back
blankly at him.</p>
<p>Turning for the third time, he perceived that
she had returned on deck. She was carrying a
small bag of old gold brocade. She was in the
chair once more as he came alongside of her; but
the blue book had slipped to the ground. He bent
to pick it up, involuntarily glancing at the title as
he handed it to her. <i>Dream Days</i>. It fitted into
his imaginings of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know it?&#8221; she queried, noticing his
glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Antony, turning the book in his
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you should,&#8221; she smiled back at him.
&#8220;That is if you have the smallest memory of your
own childhood. I was just laughing over &#8216;death
letters&#8217; ten minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Death letters?&#8221; queried Antony perplexed,
the while his heart was singing a little pæan of joy
at the vagaries of Fate&#8217;s methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; a will or testament. But a death letter
is so infinitely more explanatory. Don&#8217;t you think,
so?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>Antony laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he agreed, light breaking in upon
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the book if you care to,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
know it nearly by heart. But I had it by me, and
brought it on deck to look at it again. I didn&#8217;t
want to get absorbed in anything entirely new.
It takes one&#8217;s mind from all this, and seems a loss.&#8221;
A little gesture indicated sunshine, sea, and sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Antony, &#8220;it&#8217;s waste of time to
read in the open.&#8221; And then he stopped. &#8220;Oh,
I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;&#8221; he stammered, glancing down
at the book, and perceiving ungraciousness in
his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you did,&#8221; she assured him smiling,
&#8220;and it was quite true, and not in the least rude.
Read it in your berth some time; you can do it
there with an easy conscience.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him a little nod, which might have been
considered dismissal or a hint of emphasis. Antony,
being of course aware that she could not
possibly find it the same pleasure to talk to him as
he found it to talk to her, took it as dismissal.
With a word of thanks he moved off down the deck,
the blue book in his hands.</p>
<p>He found a retired spot forward on the boat.
A curious shyness prevented him from returning to
his own deck-chair, and reading the book within
sight of her. In spite of his little remark against
reading in the open, he was longing to make himself
acquainted with the contents immediately. Had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
it not been her recommendation? Death letters!
He laughed softly and joyously. He had never
even given the things a thought before, and here,
twice within ten days, they had been brought to
his notice in a fashion that, to his mind, fell little
short of the miraculous. And it is not at all certain
that he did not consider their second queer little
entry on the scene the more miraculous of the two.</p>
<p>He opened the book, and there, facing him from
the fly-leaf, was the answer to the question he had
erstwhile sought to fathom,&mdash;Pia di Donatello.
His lips formed the syllables, dwelling with pleasure
on the first three little letters&mdash;Pia. Oh, it
was right, it was utterly and entirely right. Every
other possibility vanished before it into the remotest
background, unthinkable in the face of
what was. Pia di Donatello! Again he repeated
the musical syllables. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;he&#8217;d
have sworn she was English. There wasn&#8217;t the
faintest trace of a foreign accent in her speech.
If anything, there was a hint of Irish,&mdash;the soft
intonation of the Emerald Isle. Her colouring,
too, was Irish, the blue-black hair, the dark violet
eyes&mdash;he had discovered that they were violet;
looking, for all the world, as if they had been put
in with a smutty finger, as the saying goes. He
revolved the problem in his mind, and a moment
later came upon the solution, so he told himself.
An Irish mother, and an Italian father, so he
decreed, metaphorically patting himself on the
back the while for his perspicacity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>The problem settled, he turned himself to the
contents of the book as set forth by the author
thereof, rather than the three words inscribed on
the fly-leaf by the owner. They were not hard of
digestion. The print was large, the matter light.
Anon he came to Mutabile Semper and the death
letters, and, having read them, and laughed in
concord with the erstwhile laugh of the book&#8217;s
owner, he closed the pages, and gazed out upon the
sunshine and the water.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A FRIENDSHIP</h3>
</div>

<p>Emerson has written a discourse on friendship.
It is beautifully worded, truly; it is full of a noble
and high-minded philosophy. Doubtless it will
appeal quite distinctly to those souls who, although
yet on this earth-plane, have already partly
cast off the mantle of flesh, and have found their
paths to lie in the realm of spirit. Even to those,
and it is by far the greater majority, who yet walk
humdrumly along the world&#8217;s great highway, the
kingdom of the spirit perceived by them as in a
glass darkly rather than by actual light shed upon
them from its realm, it may bring some consolation
during the absence of a friend. But for the general
run of mankind it is set on too lofty a level. It
lacks the warmth for which they crave, the personality
and intercourse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do then, with my friends as I do with my
books,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I would have them where I
can find them, but I seldom use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it is very certain that, for the majority
of human beings, the friendliest books are worn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
with much handling. If we picture for a moment
the bookshelves belonging to our childish days, we
shall at once mentally discover our old favourites.
They have been used so often. They have been
worn in our service. No matter how well we know
the contents, we turn to them again and again;
there is a very joy in knowing what to expect.
Time does not age nor custom stale the infinite
variety.</p>
<p>Thus it is in our childish days. And are not
the majority of us still children? Should our
favourite books be placed out of our reach, should
it be impossible for us to turn their pages, it is
certain that we would feel a loss, a gap. Were we
old enough to comprehend Emerson&#8217;s philosophy,
we might endeavour to buoy ourselves up with the
thought that thus we were at one with him in his
nobility and loftiness of sentiment. And yet
there would be something childish and pathetic
in the endeavour, by reason of its very unreality.
Certainly if Providence should, either directly or
indirectly, separate us from our friends, by all
means let us accept the separation bravely. It
cannot destroy our friendship. But seldom to use
our friends, from the apparently epicurean point
of view of Emerson, would be a forced and unnatural
doctrine to the majority, as unnatural as
if a child should bury Hans Andersen&#8217;s fairy tales
for fear of tiring of them. It would savour more
of present and actual distaste, than the love which
fears its approach. There is the familiarity which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
breeds contempt, truly; but there is also the
familiarity which daily ties closer bonds, draws
to closer union.</p>
<p>Antony had established a friendship with the
lady of the blue book. The book had been responsible
for its beginning. With Emerson&#8217;s
definition of friendship he would probably have
been largely in harmony; not so in his treatment of
it. With the following, he would have been at one,
with the exception of a word or so:&mdash;&#8220;I must feel
pride in my friend&#8217;s accomplishments as if they
were mine,&mdash;wild, delicate, throbbing property in
his virtues. I feel as warmly when he is praised,
as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged
maiden. We over-estimate the conscience of our
friend. His goodness seems better than our goodness,
his nature finer, his temptations less. Everything
that is his, his name, his form, his dress,
books, and instruments, fancy enhances. Our
own thought sounds new and larger from his
mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most true, Antony would have declared, if you
will eliminate &#8220;over-estimate,&#8221; and substitute
&#8220;is&#8221; for &#8220;seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike Emerson, he made no attempt to analyse
his friendship. He accepted it as a gift from the
gods. Maybe somewhere in his inner consciousness,
barely articulate even to his own heart, he
dreamt of it as a foundation to something further.
Yet for the present, the foundation sufficed.
Death-letters&mdash;he laughed joyously at the coincidence&mdash;had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
laid the first stone, and each day
placed others in firm and secure position round it.
The building was largely unconscious. It is the
way with true friendship. The life, also, conduced
to it. There are fewer barriers of convention on
board ship than in any other mode of living. Mrs.
Grundy, it is to be supposed, suffers from sea-sickness,
and does not care for this method of
travelling. In fact, it would appear that she seldom
does travel, but chooses by preference small
country towns, mainly English ones, for her place
of residence.</p>
<p>The days were days of sunshine and colour,
the changing colour of sea and sky; the nights
were nights of mystery, veiled in purple, star-embroidered.</p>
<p>One day Pia made clear to him the explanation
of her Irish colouring and her Italian surname.
Her mother, she told him, was Irish; her father,
English. Her baptismal name had been chosen
by an Italian godmother. She was eighteen when
she married the Duc di Donatello. On their
wedding day, when driving from the church, the
horses had bolted. She had been uninjured; he
had received serious injuries to his head and spine.
He had lived for seven years as a complete invalid,
totally paralysed, but fully conscious. During
those seven years, she had never left him. Two
years previously he had died, and she had gone to
live at her old home in England,&mdash;the Manor
House, Woodleigh, which had been in the hands of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
caretakers since her parents&#8217; death. Her husband&#8217;s
property had passed to his brother. The
last six months she had been staying with a friend
at Wynberg.</p>
<p>She told the little tale extremely simply. It
never occurred to her to expect sympathy on
account of the tragedy which had marred her
youth, and by reason of which she had spent seven
years of her life in almost utter seclusion. The fact
was merely mentioned in necessary explanation of
her story. Antony, too, had held silence. Sympathy
on his part would have been somehow an
intrusion, an impertinence. But he understood
now, in part at least, the steady gravity, the hint
of sadness in her eyes.</p>
<p>The name of Woodleigh awoke vague memories
in his mind, but they were too vague to be noteworthy.
Possibly, most probably, he told himself,
he had merely read of the place at some time. She
mentioned that it was in Devonshire, but curiously
enough, and this was an omission which he noted
later with some surprise, he never questioned her
as to its exact locality.</p>
<p>On his side, he told her of his life on the veldt,
and mentioned that he was returning to England
on business. On the outcome of that same business
would depend the question whether he remained
in England, or whether he returned to
the veldt. Having the solicitor&#8217;s injunction in
view, he naturally did not volunteer further
information. Such details, too, sank into insignificance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
before the more absorbing interest of
personality. They are, after all, in a sense, mere
accidents, and have no more to do with the real
man than the clothes he wears. True, the manner
in which one dons one&#8217;s clothes, as the manner in
which one deals with the accidental facts of life,
affords a certain index to the true man; but
the clothes themselves, and the accidental facts,
appear, at all events, to be matters of fate.
And if you can obtain knowledge of a man
through actual contact with his personality,
you do not trouble to draw conclusions from
his method of donning his clothes. You may
speculate in this fashion with regard to strangers,
or mere acquaintances. You have a surer, and
infinitely more interesting, fashion with your
friends.</p>
<p>Life around them moved on in the leisurely,
almost indolent manner in which it does move on
board a passenger ship. The younger members
played quoits, cricket on the lower deck, and inaugurated
concerts, supported by a gramaphone,
the property of the chief officer, and banjo solos
by the captain. The older members read magazines,
played bridge, or knitted woollen articles,
according to the promptings of their sex and their
various natures, and formed audiences at the aforementioned
concerts.</p>
<p>Antony and the Duchessa di Donatello alone
seemed somewhat aloof from them. They formed
part of the concert audiences, it is true; but they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
neither played bridge, quoits, nor cricket, nor
knitted woollen articles, nor read magazines. The
Duchessa employed her time with a piece of fine
lace work, when she was not merely luxuriating in
the sunshine, or conversing with Antony. Antony
either conversed with the Duchessa, or sat in his
deck chair, smoking and thinking about her.
There was certainly a distinct sameness about the
young man&#8217;s occupation, which, however, he
found not in the smallest degree boring. On the
contrary, it was all-absorbing and fascinating.
The very hours of the day were timed by the
Duchessa&#8217;s movements, rather than by the mere
minute portions of steel attached to the face of a
commonplace watch. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>Dawn. He realizes the Duchessa&#8217;s existence
when he wakes. (His dreams had been coloured
by her, but that&#8217;s beside the mark.)</p>
<p>Daybreak. The Duchessa ascends on deck and
smiles at him.</p>
<p>Breakfast time. The Duchessa sits opposite
to him.</p>
<p>The sunny morning hours. The Duchessa sews
fine lace; she talks, she smiles,&mdash;the smile that
radiates through the sadness of her eyes.</p>
<p>And so on, throughout the day, till the evening
gloaming brings a hint of further intimacy into
their conversation, and night falls as she wishes
him pleasant dreams before descending to her
cabin.</p>
<p>He dwelt then, for the moment, solely in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
friendship, but vaguely the half articulate thought
of the future began to stir within him, pulsing with
a secret possibility of joy he barely dared to
contemplate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>AT TENERIFFE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was about ten o&#8217;clock of a sunny morning that
the <i>Fort Salisbury</i> cast anchor off Teneriffe, preparatory
to undergoing the process known as
coaling.</p>
<p>Antony, from her decks, gazed towards the shore
and the buildings lying in the sunlight. Minute
doll-like figures were busy on the land; mules, with
various burdens, were ascending the steep street.
Boats were already putting out to the ship, to
carry ashore such passengers as desired to spend
a few hours on land.</p>
<p>The whole scene was one of movement, light,
and colour. The sea, sky, and earth were singing
the Benedicite, and Antony&#8217;s heart echoed the
blessings. It was all so astonishingly good and
pleasant,&mdash;the clean, fresh morning, the blue blue
of the sky, the green blue of the water, and the
possibilities of the unknown mountain land lying
before him.</p>
<p>There is an extraordinary fascination in exploring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
an unknown land, even if the exploration
is to be of somewhat limited duration. The ship
by which Antony had travelled to the Cape, had
sailed straight out; it had passed the peak of Teneriffe
at a distance. Antony had looked at it as
it rose from the sea, like a great purple amethyst
half veiled in cloud. He had wondered then,
idly enough, whether it would ever be his lot to
set foot upon its shores. Never, in his wildest
dreams, had he imagined under what actual circumstances
that lot would be his. How could he
have guessed at what the fates were holding in
store for him? They had held their secret close,
giving him no smallest inkling of it. If we dream
of paradise, our dream is modelled on the greatest
happiness we have known; therefore, since our
happiness is, doubtless, but a rushlight as compared
to the sunshine of paradise, our dreams must
necessarily fall exceedingly far short of the reality.
Hitherto Antony&#8217;s happiness had been largely
monochrome, flecked with tiny specks of radiance.
He might indeed have dreamed of something a
trifle brighter, but how was it possible for him to
have formed from them the smallest conception
of the happiness that was awaiting him?</p>
<p>&#8220;It is really perfect,&#8221; said a voice behind him,
echoing his thoughts.</p>
<p>Antony turned.</p>
<p>The Duchessa had come on deck, spurred and
gauntleted for their adventure,&mdash;in other words,
attired in a soft, black dress, a shady black hat on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
her head, crinkly black gloves, which reached to
the elbow, on her hands, and carrying a blue sunshade.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is really perfect,&#8221; she repeated, gazing towards
the mountainous land before them, the doll-like
figures on the shore, the boats cleaving the
sparkling waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; declared Antony, his eyes wrinkling
at the corners in sheer delight. &#8220;The gods
have favoured us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a boat ready?&#8221; she demanded, eager
as a child to start on the adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;A boat,&#8221; said Antony, looking over the ship&#8217;s
side, &#8220;will be with us in a couple of moments I
should say, to judge by the strength of the rower&#8217;s
arms. He has been racing the other fellows, and
will be first at his goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let us be first too.
I don&#8217;t want to lose a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony followed in her wake. Her sentiments
most assuredly were his. It was not a day of
which to squander one iota.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they were on their way to the
shore. Behind them the <i>Fort Salisbury</i> loomed up
large and black from the limpid water; before them
lay the land of possibilities.</p>
<p>The other passengers in the boat kept up a
running fire of comments. A stout gentleman in
a sun-helmet, which he considered <i>de rigeur</i> as
long as he was anywhere at all near the regions of
Africa, gazed towards the shore through a pair of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
field-glasses. At intervals he made known such
objects of interest as he observed, in loud husky
asides to his wife, a small meek woman, who clung
to him, metaphorically speaking, as the ivy to the
oak. Her vision being unaided by field-glasses,
she was unable to follow his observations with the
degree of intelligence he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I quite&mdash;&#8221; she remarked anxiously
now and again, blinking in the same direction
as her spouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the left, my dear, among the trees,&#8221; he
would reply. Or, &#8220;Half-way up the street.
<i>Now</i> don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; Or, removing the field-glasses
for a moment to observe the direction of her
anxious blinking, &#8220;Why, bless my soul, you aren&#8217;t
looking the right way <i>at all</i>. Get it in a line with
that chimney over there, and the yellow house.
The <i>yellow</i> house. You&#8217;re looking straight at the
pink one. Bless my soul, tut, tut.&#8221; And so forth.</p>
<p>A small boy, leaning far over the side of the
boat, gazed rapturously into the water, announcing
in shrill tones that he could see to the very bottom,
an anxious elder sister grasping the back of his
jersey meanwhile. A girl with a pigtail jumped
about in a manner calculated to bring an abrupt
and watery conclusion to the passage, till forcibly
restrained by her melancholy-looking father. A
young man announced that it was going to be,
&#8220;Deuced hot on shore, what?&#8221; And a gushing
young thing of some forty summers appealed to
everyone at intervals to know the hour to the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
second it would be necessary to return, since it
really would be a sin to keep the ship waiting.
While the remarks from an elderly and cynical
gentleman, that, in the event of unpunctuality
on her part, it would be more probable that she
would find herself waiting indefinitely at Teneriffe,
caused her to giggle hysterically, and label him a
naughty man.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a matter for devout thankfulness,&#8221; said
the Duchessa some ten minutes later, as she and
Antony were walking across the square, &#8220;that the
<i>Fort Salisbury</i> is large enough to permit of a certain
separation from one&#8217;s fellow humans. I do
not wish to be uncharitable, but their proximity
does not always appeal to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony laughed, and tossed some coppers to a
small brown-faced girl, who, clasping an infant
nearly as large as herself, jabbered at him in an
unknown but wholly understandable language.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be besieged and bankrupt before you
see the ship again, if you begin that,&#8221; warned the
Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite possible,&#8221; returned Antony smiling.</p>
<p>The Duchessa shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you are in that mood, warnings are waste
of breath,&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; agreed Antony, still smiling.</p>
<p>He was radiantly, idiotically happy. The joy
of the morning, the brilliance of the sunshine, and
the fact that the Duchessa was walking by his
side, had gone to his head like wine. If the expenditure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
of coppers could impart one tenth of his
happiness to others, he would fling them broadcast,
he would be a very spendthrift with his gladness.</p>
<p>At the church to the left of the square, the
Duchessa paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;In here first,&#8221; she said. And Antony followed
her up the steps.</p>
<p>They made their way through a swarm of grubby
children, and entered the porch. It was cool and
dark in the church in contrast to the heat and sunshine
without. Here and there Antony descried
a kneeling figure,&mdash;women with handkerchiefs on
their heads, and a big basket beside them; an old
man or two; a girl telling her beads before the Lady
Altar; and a small dark-haired child, who gazed
stolidly at the Duchessa. Votive candles burned
before the various shrines. The ruby lamp made
a spot of light in the shadows above the High
Altar.</p>
<p>The Duchessa dropped on one knee, and then
knelt for a few moments at one of the <i>prie-dieux</i>.
Antony watched her. He was sensible that she
was not a mere sight-seer. The church held an
element of home for her. Two of the passengers&mdash;the
young man and the cynical elderly gentleman,
who had been in the boat with them&mdash;strolled in
behind him. They gazed curiously about, remarking
in loudish whispers on what they saw.
Antony felt suddenly, and quite unreasonably,
annoyed at their entry. Somehow they detracted
from the harmony and peace of the building.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were a Catholic,&#8221; he said
five minutes later, as he and the Duchessa emerged
once more into the sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never asked me,&#8221; she returned smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Antony. And then he added
simply, as an afterthought, &#8220;it didn&#8217;t occur to me
to ask you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; responded the Duchessa, a little
twinkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Antony again. &#8220;I wish those
people hadn&#8217;t come in,&#8221; he added somewhat
irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What people?&#8221; demanded the Duchessa. &#8220;Oh,
you mean those two men. Why not? Most
tourists visit the church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; returned Antony. &#8220;But&mdash;well,
they didn&#8217;t belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; queried the Duchessa innocently.</p>
<p>Antony reddened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said a little stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, forgive me.&#8221; The Duchessa&#8217;s voice held
a note of quick contrition. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to
hurt you. Somehow we Catholics get used to
Protestants regarding our churches merely as a
sight to be seen, and for the moment I smiled to
think that <i>you</i> should be the one whom it irritated.
But I do know what you mean, of course. And&mdash;I&#8217;m
<i>glad</i> you felt it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he returned smiling.</p>
<p>The little cloud, which had momentarily dimmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the brightness of his sun, was dispelled. The
merest inflection in the Duchessa&#8217;s voice had the
power of casting him down to depths of heart-searching
despair, or lifting him to realms of
intoxicating joy. And it must be confessed that
the past fortnight had been spent almost continuously
in these realms. Also, if he had sunk to the
depths of despair, it was rather by reason of an
ultra-sensitive imagination on his own part than
by any fault of the Duchessa&#8217;s. But then, as
Antony would have declared, the position of a subject
to his sovereign is a very different matter from
the position of the sovereign to the subject. The
Duchessa could be certain of his loyalty. It was
for her to give or withhold favours as it pleased her.
It was a different matter for him.</p>
<p>It is not easy for a man, who has lived a very
lonely life, to believe in a reciprocal friendship
where he himself is concerned. A curious admixture
of shyness and diffidence, the outcome of his
lonely life, prevented him from imagining that the
Duchessa could desire his friendship in the smallest
degree as he desired hers. To him, the friendship
she had accorded him had become the most
vital thing in his existence, quite apart from
that vague and intoxicating dream, which he
scarcely dared to confess in the faintest whisper
to his heart. He knew that her friendship appeared
essential to his very life. But how could he
for one moment imagine that his friendship was
essential to her? It could not be, though he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
cheerfully have laid down his life for her, have
undergone torture for her sake.</p>
<p>Knowing, therefore, that his friendship was
not essential to her happiness, yet knowing what
her friendship meant to him, he was as ultra-sensitive
as a lonely child. His soul sprang forward
to receive her gifts, but the merest imagined hint
of a rebuff would have sent him back to that loneliness
he had learned to look upon as his birthright.
Not that he would have gone back to that loneliness
with a hurt sense of injury. That must be
clearly understood to understand Antony. To
have felt injury, would have been tantamount to
saying that he had had a right to the friendship,
and it was just this very right that Antony could
not realize as in the least existent. He would have
gone back with an ache, it is true, but with a brave
face, and an overwhelming and life-long gratitude
for the temporary joy. That is at the present
moment; of later, one cannot feel so certain.</p>
<p>To-day, however, loneliness seemed a thing
unthinkable, unimaginable, with the Duchessa by
his side, and the golden day ahead of him. By
skilled man&oelig;uvring, and avoiding the recognized
hours of meal-time, they managed to escape further
contact with their fellow passengers.</p>
<p>An exceedingly late luncheon hour found them
the sole occupants of a small courtyard at the back
of an hotel,&mdash;a courtyard set with round tables,
and orange trees in green tubs. Over the roofs
of the houses, and far below them, they could see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the shining water, and the <i>Fort Salisbury</i>, lying like
a dark blob on its surface. Boats bearing coal were
still putting out to her, and men were busy hauling
it over her sides.</p>
<p>The Duchessa looked down on the ship and the
water.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is queer to think,&#8221; said she smiling, &#8220;that
little more than a week hence, I shall be in Scotland,
and, probably, shivering in furs. It can be
exceedingly chilly up there, even as late as May.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were going to your old home,&#8221;
said Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I am,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;but not till nearly the
end of June. I am going to stay with friends in
Edinburgh first. Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony lifted his shoulders in the merest suspicion
of a shrug.</p>
<p>&#8220;London first,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;After that&mdash;well,
it&#8217;s on the knees of the gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you likely to stay in England long?&#8221; she
asked. And then she added quickly, &#8220;You don&#8217;t
think the question an impertinence, I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; he answered smiling. &#8220;But I
really don&#8217;t know yet myself. It will depend on
various things.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case, I shall see you before I leave
England again, if I may,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is, if I
do leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa was still looking at the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will,&#8221; she replied. And then she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
turned towards him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want our friendship
to end completely with the voyage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony&#8217;s heart gave a little leap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it really is a friendship?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t it been?&#8221; she asked him.</p>
<p>Antony looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, yes,&#8221; he replied steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can a friendship be one-sided?&#8221; she demanded.
She emphasised the word a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Antony whimsically. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know much about them. I haven&#8217;t ever
wanted one before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was a little silence. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the Duchessa.</p>
<p>Antony drew a long breath. They were such
simple little words; and yet, to him, they meant
more than the longest and most flowery of speeches.
There was so infinitely more conveyed in them.
And he knew that, if they had not been meant,
they would not have been spoken. She did think
his friendship worth while, and she had given him
hers. It was all his heart dared ask at the moment,
yet, deep within it, his secret hope stirred to
fuller life. And then, suddenly, prompted by
some instinct, quite unexplainable at the moment,
he put a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the foundation of friendship?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust,&#8221; she responded quickly, her eyes meeting
his for a moment. &#8220;And here,&#8221; she said, looking
towards the hotel, &#8220;comes our lunch.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>It was sunset before the <i>Fort Salisbury</i> was
once more cleaving her way through the water.
Antony, from her decks, looked once more at the
receding land. Again he saw it rising, like a
purple amethyst, from the sea, but this time it was
veiled in the rose-coloured light of the sinking sun.
He looked towards that portion of the amethyst
where the little courtyard with the orange trees in
green tubs was situated.</p>
<p>Once more he heard his question and the
Duchessa&#8217;s answer. It was a memory which was
to remain with him for many a month.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ENGLAND</h3>
</div>

<p>A week later, Antony was sitting in a first-class
carriage on his way from Plymouth to Waterloo.
He gazed through the window, his mind
filled with various emotions.</p>
<p>Uppermost was the memory of the voyage and
the Duchessa. The memory already appeared to
him almost as a vivid and extraordinarily beautiful
dream, though reason assured him to the contrary.
The whole events of the last month, and even his
present position in the train, appeared to him
intangible and unreal. It seemed a dream self,
rather than the real Antony, who was gazing
from the window at the landscape which was slipping
past him; who was looking out on the English
fields, the English woods, and the English cottages
past which the train was tearing. He saw gardens
ablaze with flowers; bushes snowy with hawthorn;
horses and cows standing idly in the shadow of the
trees; and, now and again, small, trimly-kept
country stations, looking for all the world like prim
schoolgirls in gay print dresses.</p>
<p>He glanced from the window to the rack opposite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
to him, where his portmanteau was lying. That,
at all events, was tangible, real, and familiar. It
struck the sole familiar note in the extraordinary
unfamiliarity of everything around him. He
looked at his own initials painted on it, slowly
tracing them in his mind. He pulled out his
pocket-book, and took from it the letter which had
altered the whole perspective of his life. He
could almost see the African stoep as he looked
at it, feel the heat of the African sun, hear the
occasional chirping of the grasshoppers. Age-old
the memory appeared, caught from bygone centuries.
And it was only a month ago. Replacing
it in the book, his eye fell upon a small piece of
pasteboard. The Duchessa had given it to him
that morning. Her name was printed on it, and
below she had written a few pencilled words,&mdash;her
address in Scotland. She was remaining in
Plymouth for a day or so, before going North.
He was to write to her at the Scotland address,
and let her know where she could acquaint him
with her further movements, and the actual date
of her return to the Manor House. That, too,
was tangible and real,&mdash;that small piece of white
pasteboard. And, then, a little movement beside
him, and a long quivering sigh of content brought
back to him the most tangible thing of all&mdash;Josephus.
Josephus, who was sleeping the sleep
of the contented, just after a frenzied and rapturous
reunion with his deity.</p>
<p>Oh, of course it was all real, and it was he,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
Antony, his very self, who was sitting in the train,
the train which was rushing through the good old
English country, carrying him towards London and
the answer to the riddle contained in that most
amazing of letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a dream, Josephus,&#8221; he assured the
sleepy puppy. &#8220;I am real, you are real, the
train is real, England is real, and Heaven be
praised&mdash;the Duchessa is real.&#8221; After which act
of assurance he turned his attention once more to
the window.</p>
<p>And now, the dream sense dispelled, he found
long-forgotten memories awaken within him,
memories of early boyhood, aroused by the sight
of some old church tower, of some wood lying on a
hillside, of some amber stream rippling past rush-grown
banks. He hugged the memories to his soul,
rejoicing in them. They brought a dozen trivial
little incidents to his mind. He could hear his old
nurse&#8217;s voice warning him not to lean against
the door of the carriage. He could feel his small
nose pressed against the window-pane, his small
hand rubbing the glass where it had been dimmed
by his breath. He could hear the crackle of
paper bags, as sandwiches and buns were produced
for his refreshment; he could taste the
ham between the pieces of bread and butter;
and he could see a small boy, with one eye on
his nurse, pushing a piece of fat between the
cushions of the seat and the side of the carriage.
This last memory evoked a little chuckle of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
laughter. That nurse had been a strong disciplinarian.</p>
<p>The memories linked together, forming a more
connected whole. He recalled places farther afield
than those caught sight of from the window of
the train. He remembered a copse yellow with
primroses, a pond where he had fished for sticklebacks,
a bank with a robin&#8217;s nest in it. He
remembered a later visit with an aunt. He must
then have been fourteen or thereabouts. There
had been a small girl, staying with her aunt at a
neighbouring farm, who had accompanied him on
his rambles. Despite her tender age&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t
have been more than five years old&mdash;she had been
the inventor of their worst escapades. It was she
who had egged him on to the attempt to cross the
pond on a log of wood, racing round it to shout
encouragement from the opposite side. The
timely advent of one of the farm-labourers alone
had saved him from a watery grave. It was she
who had invented the bows and arrows with which
he had accidentally shot the prize bantam, and it
was she who had insisted on his going with her to
search for pheasants&#8217; eggs, a crime for which he
barely escaped the penalty of the law.</p>
<p>He remembered her as a fragile fair-haired child,
with a wide-eyed innocence of expression, utterly
at variance with her true character. In spite of
her nobly shouldering her full share of the blame,
he had invariably been considered sole culprit,
which he most assuredly was not, though weight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
of years should have taught him better. But then,
one could hardly expect the Olympians to lay any
measure of such crimes at the door of a grey-eyed,
fair-haired angel. And that was what she had
appeared to mere superficial observation. It
required extreme perspicacity of vision, or great
intimacy, to arrive at anything a trifle nearer the
truth. He sought in the recesses of his memory
for her name. That it had suited her admirably,
and that it was monosyllabic, was all he could remember.
After a few minutes fruitless search, he
abandoned it as hopeless, and pulled pipe and
tobacco pouch from his pocket.</p>
<p>Presently he saw the square tower and pinnacles
of Exeter Cathedral above some trees, and the
train ran into the station. Antony watched the
people on the platform with interest. They were
English, and it was thirteen years since he had
been in England. He listened to the fragmentary
English sentences he heard, finding pleasure in the
sound. He marvelled idly at the lack of colour in
the scene before him. The posters on the walls
alone struck a flamboyant note. Yet there was
something restful in the monochrome of the dresses,
the dull smoke-griminess of the station. At all
events it was a contrast to the vivid colouring of
the African veldt.</p>
<p>Despite his interest in his fellow humans, however,
he found himself devoutly trusting his privacy
would remain undisturbed, and it was with a
sense of relief that he felt the train glide slowly out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
of the station, leaving him the sole occupant of his
compartment.</p>
<p>Later, he saw the spire of Salisbury Cathedral.
Again fortune favoured him in the matter of privacy,
and presently drowsiness descended on his
eyelids, which was not fully dispelled till the train
ran into the gloom of Waterloo station.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE AMAZING CONDITIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>The offices of Messrs. Parsons and Glieve,
solicitors, are situated off the Strand, and within
seven minutes&#8217; walk of Covent Garden. It is an
old-established and exceedingly respectable firm.
Its respectability is emphasized by the massiveness
of its furniture and the age of its office boy. He
is fifty, if he is a day. An exceeding slowness of
brain prevented him from rising to a more exalted
position, a position to which his quite extraordinary
conscientiousness and honesty would have
entitled him. That same conscientiousness and
honesty prevented him from being superseded by
a more juvenile individual, when his age had
passed the limit usually accorded to office boys.
Imperceptibly almost, he became part and parcel
of the firm, a thing no more to be dispensed with
than the brass plate outside the office. He appeared
now as an elderly and exceedingly reputable
butler, and his appearance quite enormously
increased the respectability of the firm.</p>
<p>Nominally James Glieve and Henry Parsons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
were partners of equal standing, neither claiming
seniority to the other; virtually James Glieve
was the voice, Henry Parsons the echo. In
matters of great importance, they received clients
in company, Henry Parsons playing the part of
Greek chorus to James Glieve&#8217;s lead. In matters
of less importance, they each had their own
particular clients; but it is very certain that,
even thus, Henry Parsons invariably echoed
the voice. It merely meant that the voice had
sounded in private, while the echo was heard in
public.</p>
<p>When George, the office-boy-butler, presented
James Glieve with a small piece of pasteboard, on
the morning following Antony&#8217;s arrival in town,
with the statement that the gentleman was in the
waiting-room, James Glieve requested the instant
presence of Henry Parsons, prior to the introduction
of Antony. From which token it will be
justly observed that the matter in hand was of
importance. In James Glieve&#8217;s eyes it was of
extreme importance, and that by reason of its
being extremely unusual.</p>
<p>Some six weeks previously an unknown client
had made his appearance in the person of a big
clean-shaven man, by name Doctor Hilary St.
John. Henry Parsons happened, this time quite
by accident, to be present at the interview. The
big man had made certain statements in an
exceedingly business-like manner, and had then
requested Messrs. Parsons and Glieve to act on his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
behalf, or, rather, on behalf of the person for
whom he was emissary.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, bless my soul,&#8221; James Glieve had boomed
amazed, on the conclusion of the request, &#8220;I
never heard such a thing in my life. It&mdash;I am not
at all sure that it is legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all sure that it is legal,&#8221; Henry Parsons
had echoed.</p>
<p>The big man had laughed, recapitulated his
statements, and urged his point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how it can be done,&#8221; James Glieve
had responded obstinately.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be done,&#8221; the echo had repeated with
even greater assurance than the voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it can,&#8221; Doctor Hilary had replied
with greater assurance still. &#8220;See here&mdash;&#8221; and he
had begun all over again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut,&#8221; James Glieve had clucked on the
conclusion of the third recital. &#8220;You&#8217;ve said all
that before. I tell you, man, the whole business
is too unusual. It&mdash;I&#8217;m sure it isn&#8217;t legal. And
anyhow it&#8217;s mad. What&#8217;s the name of your&mdash;er,
your deceased friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The name?&#8221; piped Henry Parsons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Danver,&#8221; had been the brief response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Danver!&#8221; James Glieve had almost
shouted the words. &#8220;Nicholas Danver! God
bless my soul!&#8221; And he had leant back in his chair
and shaken with laughter. Henry Parsons, true
to his rôle, had chuckled at intervals, but feebly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
For the life of him he could see no cause for
mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nick, Nick,&#8221; sighed James Glieve, wiping
his eyes after a few minutes, &#8220;I always vowed
you&#8217;d be the death of me. To think of you turning
up in the life of a staid elderly solicitor at this
hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry Parsons stared. And this time his voice
found no echo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Doctor,&#8221; said James Glieve, stuffing
his handkerchief back into his pocket, &#8220;I suppose
I&mdash;&#8221; he broke off. &#8220;This is a most respectable
firm of solicitors,&#8221; he remarked suddenly and
almost fiercely. &#8220;We&#8217;d never dream of stooping
to anything approaching fraud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not dream of it,&#8221; echoed Henry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; said Doctor Hilary heartily.
&#8220;But this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I daresay, I daresay. Now then,
what are your propositions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your propositions?&#8221; echoed Henry.</p>
<p>And a fourth time Doctor Hilary repeated them.</p>
<p>At the end of a lengthy interview, James Glieve
opened the door of his sanctum to show Doctor
Hilary out.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might give my kindest remembrances&mdash;&#8221;
he stopped. &#8220;Bless my soul, I was just going to
send my remembrances to old Nick, and we&#8217;ve
been spending the last hour settling up his will.
Where&#8217;s my memory going! I shall probably run
down in a few days, and go through matters with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
you on the spot. A&mdash;er, a melancholy pleasure
to see the old place again. What?&#8221;</p>
<p>Henry Parsons, within the room, lost this last
speech; therefore it found no echo.</p>
<p>When Antony entered the private sanctum of
James Glieve, he saw a stout red-faced man,
with a suspicion of side whiskers and a slight
appearance of ferocity, seated at a desk. On
his right, and insignificant by comparison,
was a small grey-haired and rather dried-up
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Antony Gray?&#8221; queried the red-faced
man, looking at Antony over his spectacles.</p>
<p>Antony bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come in answer to our communication
regarding the will of the&mdash;er, late Mr. Nicholas
Danver?&#8221; asked James Glieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; responded Antony. And he drew
the said communication from his pocket, and laid
it on the table.</p>
<p>James Glieve glanced at it. Then he leant
back in his chair, put his elbows on its arms, and
placed the tips of his fingers together.</p>
<p>&#8220;The&mdash;er, the conditions of the will are somewhat
unusual,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;It is my duty to
set them plainly before you. Should you refuse
them, we are to see that you are fully recompensed
for any expense and inconvenience your journey
will have entailed. Should you, on the other
hand, accept them, it is understood that as a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
of honour you will fulfil the conditions exactly,
not only in the letter, but in the spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the spirit,&#8221; echoed Henry Parsons.</p>
<p>Antony bowed in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, should you fail in your contract,&#8221;
went on James Glieve, &#8220;the will becomes null and
void. But it would be quite possible for you to
keep to the contract in the letter, while breaking it
merely in the spirit, in which case probably no one
but yourself would be aware that it had been so
broken. You will not be asked to sign any promise
in the matter. You will only be asked to give
your word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To give your word,&#8221; said Henry Parsons,
looking solemnly at Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Antony quietly.</p>
<p>James Glieve pulled a paper towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conditions,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;are as
follows. I am about to read what the&mdash;er, late
Mr. Nicholas Danver has himself written regarding
the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cleared his throat, and pushed his spectacles
back on his nose.</p>
<p>Antony looked directly at him. In spite of
the business-like appearance of the room, the
business-like attitude of the two men opposite
to him, he still felt that odd Arabian Nights&#8217;
entertainment sensation. The room and its occupants
seemed to be masquerading under a business
garb; it seemed to need but one word&mdash;if he
could have found it&mdash;to metamorphose the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
thing back to its original and true conditions, to
change the room into an Aladdin&#8217;s cave, and the
two men into a friendly giant and an attendant
dwarf. The only thing he could not see metamorphosed
was George, the office-boy-butler. He
retained his own appearance and personality.
He appeared to have been brought&mdash;as a human
boy, possibly&mdash;into the entertainment, and to
have grown up imperturbably in it. Though
quite probably, under his present respectable
demeanour, he was well aware of the true state of
affairs, and was laughing inwardly at it.</p>
<p>James Glieve cleared his throat a second time,
and began.</p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;The conditions under which I make the aforesaid
Antony Gray my heir,&#8221; he read, &#8220;are as
follows. He will not enter into possession of
either property or money for one year precisely
from the day of hearing these conditions. He
shall give his word of honour to make known to no
person whatsoever that he is my heir. He shall
live, during the said year, in a furnished cottage
on the estate, the cottage to be designated to him
by my friend Doctor Hilary St. John. He will
undertake that he lives in that cottage and nowhere
else, not even for a day. He will live
as an ordinary labourer. That this may be facilitated
he will have a post as one of the under-gardeners
in the gardens of Chorley Old Hall.
Golding, the head-gardener, will instruct him in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
his duties. He will be paid one pound sterling
per week as wage, and he shall pay a rent of five
shillings per week for the cottage. He will undertake
to use no income or capital of his own during
the said year, nor receive any help or money from
friends. Briefly, he will undertake to make the
one pound per week, which he will earn as wage,
suffice for his needs. He will take the name of
Michael Field for one year, and neither directly nor
indirectly will he acquaint any one whomsoever
with the fact that it is a pseudonym. In short, he
will do all in his power to give the impression to
everyone that he is simply and solely Michael Field,
working-man, and under-gardener at Chorley Old
Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will make his decision in the matter within
twenty-four hours, and, should his decision be in
the affirmative, he will bind himself, as a man of
honour to abide by it. And, further, he will proceed
to Byestry within one week of the decision, to
take up his duties, and his residence in the aforesaid
cottage.</p>

<p>James Glieve stopped. He did not look at
Antony, but at the paper, which he placed on the
desk in front of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; said Antony quietly and ruminatively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have twenty-four hours in which to make
your decision,&#8221; said James Glieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-four hours,&#8221; said Henry Parsons.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s as well,&#8221; returned Antony.
He was still feeling the quite absurd desire to find
the word which should metamorphose the scene
before him to its true conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you the terms of the will were unusual,&#8221;
said James Glieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very unusual,&#8221; emphasized Henry Parsons.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; said Antony dryly. Then he got
up from his chair. He looked at his watch.
&#8220;Well, Mr. Glieve, it is twelve o&#8217;clock. I will let
you know my decision by eleven o&#8217;clock to-morrow
morning. That, I believe, will entirely fulfil the
conditions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely,&#8221; said James Glieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely,&#8221; echoed Henry Parsons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p>As soon as Antony left the office, he walked
down into the Strand, where he took an omnibus as
far as Pimlico. There he dismounted, and made
his way to the embankment, intending to walk
back to his rooms in Chelsea. He had spent the
previous evening hunting for rooms solely on
Josephus&#8217;s account. Dogs, and more especially
puppies, are not welcomed at hotels; also, Antony
considered the terms demanded for this special
puppy&#8217;s housing and maintenance entirely disproportionate
to Josephus&#8217;s size and requirements.</p>
<p>As he walked along the embankment he reviewed
the situation and conditions recently placed before
him. At first sight they appeared almost amusing
and absurd. The whole thing presented itself
to the mind in the light of some huge joke; and
yet, behind the joke, lay a curious sense of inexorableness.
At first he did not in the least realize
what caused this sense, he was merely oddly aware
of its existence. He walked with his eyes on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the river, watching a couple of slowly moving
barges.</p>
<p>It was a still, sunny day. The trees on the
embankment were in full leaf. Scarlet and yellow
tulips bedecked the window-boxes in the houses
on his right. An occasional group of somewhat
grubby children, generally accompanied by an
elder sister and a baby in a perambulator, now and
again occupied a seat. A threadbare and melancholy-looking
man flung pieces of bread to a horde
of sea-gulls. Antony watched them screaming
and whirling as they snatched at the food. They
brought the <i>Fort Salisbury</i> to his mind. And
then, in a sudden flash of illumination, he saw
precisely wherein that sense of inexorableness lay.
With the realization his heart stood still; and, with
it, for the same brief second, his feet. The next
instant he had quickened his steps, fighting out
the new idea which had come to him.</p>
<p>It was not till he had reached his rooms, and
partaken of a lunch of cold meat and salad, that he
had reduced it to an entirely business-like statement.
Then, in the depths of an armchair, and
fortified by a pipe, he marshalled it in its somewhat
crude form before his brain. Briefly, it
reduced itself to the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Should he refuse the conditions attached to
the will, he remained in exactly the same position
in which he had found himself some four or five
weeks previously; namely, in the position of owner
of a small farm on the African veldt, which farm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
brought him in an income of some two hundred a
year. In that position the dream, which had
dawned within his heart on the <i>Fort Salisbury</i>,
would be impossible of fulfilment. His life and
that of the Duchessa di Donatello must lie miles
apart, separated both by lack of money and the
ocean. If, on the other hand, he accepted the
conditions, a year must elapse before he made that
dream known to her; and&mdash;and here lay the meaning
of that sense of inexorableness he had experienced&mdash;he
could give her no explanation of the
extraordinary situation in which he would find
himself, a situation truly calculated to create any
amount of misunderstanding. To all appearances
the adventure on which he had started out had
brought him to an impasse, a blind alley, from
which there was no favourable issue of any kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole thing is a deuced muddle,&#8221;
he announced gloomily, addressing himself to
Josephus.</p>
<p>Josephus put his paws on Antony&#8217;s knees, and
licked the hand which was not holding the pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;To refuse the conditions,&#8221; went on Antony
aloud, and still gloomily, and stroking Josephus&#8217;s
head, &#8220;is to bring matters to an absolute deadlock,
one from which I can never by the remotest atom
of chance extricate myself. To accept them&mdash;well,
I don&#8217;t see much better chance there. How
on earth am I to explain the situation to her?
How on earth will she understand the fact that I
remain in England, and make no attempt to see her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
for a year? I can&#8217;t even hint at the situation.
Oh, it&#8217;s preposterous! But to accept gives me the
only possible faintest hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, a memory sprang to life
within his soul. He saw again a courtyard set
with small round tables and orange trees in green
tubs. He heard his own voice putting a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the foundation of friendship?&#8221; it
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust,&#8221; came the reply, in the Duchessa&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>Yet, was her friendship strong enough to trust
him in such a matter? Strong enough not to misunderstand
his silence, his&mdash;his oddness in the whole
business? And yet, was it not something like a
confession of weakness of friendship on his own
part, to question the endurance of hers? She had
said they were friends. Perhaps the very test of
the strength of his own friendship was to lie in his
trust of the strength of hers. And, at all events, he
could write her some kind of a letter, something
that would tell her of his utter inability to see her,
even though he might not give the smallest hint of
what that inability was. At least he could let her
perceive it was by no wish of his own that he
stayed away.</p>
<p>Hope revived within his heart. On the one
hand there would be temporary banishment,
truly. But it would be infinitely preferable to life-long
exile. A year, after all, was only a year. To
him the moments might, nay would, drag on leaden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
feet; but to her it would be but as other years, and,
ordinarily speaking, they speed by at an astonishing
rate. He must look to that assurance for comfort.
A little odd smile twisted his lips. What,
after all, did a grey year signify to him, as long
as its greyness did not touch her. And why
should it? The fact of his absence could not
possibly bring the same blank to her as it would
to him. She might wonder a little, she might
even question. But had not she herself spoken of
trust?</p>
<p>With the memory of that one word for his encouragement,
he took his resolution in both hands
and made his decision.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Perhaps, if Antony had attempted to pen his
letter to the Duchessa before making his decision,
he might have hesitated regarding making it. It
was, however, not till the evening before he left
town to take up his new life, that he attempted to
write to her. Then he discovered the extraordinary
difficulty of putting into anything like coherent
and convincing words the statement he had to
make. He drafted at least a dozen attempts, each,
to his mind, more unsatisfactory than the last.
Finally he wrote as follows:</p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Duchessa:</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Since I said good-bye to you at Plymouth, my
affairs have undergone unexpected and quite unforeseen
changes. As matters stand at present, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
shall be remaining in England for some time. I had
hoped to see you when you returned from Scotland,
but find, deeply to my regret, that I will be unable
to do so, for a considerable time at all events.
Need I tell you that this is a great disappointment
to me? I had been looking forward to seeing you
again, and now fate has taken matters out of my
hands. When the time comes that I am able to
see you, I will write and let you know; and perhaps,
if by then you have not forgotten me, you
will allow me to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to thank you for your kindness
and comradeship to me during the voyage. Those
days will ever remain as a golden memory to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having in mind your words when we lunched
together in the garden of that little hotel at
Teneriffe, I dare to inscribe myself,</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Always your friend,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Antony Gray.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was not the letter he longed to write, yet
he dared not write more explicitly. Honour forbade
the smallest hint at the strange position in
which he found himself; diffidence held him back
from writing the words his heart was crying to her.
Bald and flat as he felt the letter to be, he could do
no better. It must go as it stood. He headed it
with the address of his present rooms, giving his
landlady instructions to forward all letters to the
post office at Byestry.</p>
<p>One letter, bearing a Scottish postmark, alone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
came for him after his departure. It remained
for close on two months on the table of the dingy
little hall. Then, fearing lest Antony&#8217;s receipt of it
should betray her own carelessness, Mrs. Dobbin
consigned it unopened to the kitchen fire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>AN ENGLISH COTTAGE</h3>
</div>

<p>Kingsleigh is the station for Byestry, which
is eight miles from it. It is a small town, not much
larger than a mere village, lying, as its name designates,
on the shores of the estuary, which runs from
the sea up to Kingsleigh. Chorley Old Hall
stands on high wooded land, about a mile from the
coast, having a view across the estuary, and out to
the sea itself.</p>
<p>It was a grey day, with a fine mist of a rain
descending, when Antony, with Josephus at his
heels, stepped on to Kingsleigh platform. In the
road beyond the station, a number of carts and
carriages, and a couple of closed buses, were collected.
The drivers of the said vehicles stood by
the gate through which the passengers must pass,
ready to accost those by whom they had been
already ordered, or pounce upon likely fares.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be yü Michael Field?&#8221; demanded a short
wiry man, as Antony, carrying an old portmanteau,
and followed by Josephus, emerged through the
gate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>For a moment Antony stared, amazed. Then
he remembered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s güd,&#8221; responded the man cheerfully.
&#8220;&#8217;It the first nail, so to speak. T&#8217;Doctor
sent I wi&#8217; t&#8217;trap. Coom along. Got any more
baggage?&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony replied in the negative. Three minutes
later he was seated in the trap, Josephus at his
feet. He turned up the collar of his mackintosh,
and pulled down his tweed cap over his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bit moist-like,&#8221; said the man cheerfully,
whipping up his horse.</p>
<p>Antony assented. He was feeling an amazing
sense of amusement. The adventurous side of the
affair had sprung again to the fore, after a week of
business-like detail,&mdash;writing letters of instruction
to Riffle to carry on with the farm till further
notice, an office he was fully qualified to fulfil;
making certain arrangements with Lloyd&#8217;s bank
regarding monies to be sent out to him; buying garments
suitable for the part he himself was about
to play; and having one or two further interviews
with Messrs. Parsons and Glieve, in which the
absolute necessity of his playing up to his rôle
in every way was further impressed upon him.</p>
<p>The one difficulty that had presented itself to
his mind, was his speech. He spent several half
hours conversing with himself in broadest Devonshire,
but finally decided that, it being the speech
of the natives, he might sooner or later betray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
himself by some inadvertent lapse. Next he
attempted a Colonial accent. James Glieve, however,
being consulted on the subject, it was firmly
negatived as likely to prove unpopular. In the
end he fell back on a strong Irish accent. It came
to him readily enough, the nurse of his childhood
having hailed from the Emerald Isle. Possibly his
actual phraseology would not prove all it might be,
but the Devonians were not likely to be much the
wiser. Anyhow Antony admired his own prowess
in the tongue quite immensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis the foine country ye have here,&#8221;
quoth he presently, as, mounting a hill, they came
out upon a road crossing an expanse of moorland.
Gorse bushes bloomed golden against a
background of grey sky and atmosphere, seen
through a fine veil of rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis güd enuff,&#8221; said the man laconically.
And Antony perceived that the beauties of nature
held no particular interest for him.</p>
<p>He looked out at the wide expanses around him.
Mist covered the farther distances, but through it,
afar off, he fancied he could descry the grey line of
the sea. To the right the moorland gave place to
a distant stone wall, beyond which was a wheat
field; to the left it stretched away into the mist,
through which he saw the dim shapes of trees.</p>
<p>The man jerked his head to the left.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis over yonder is t&#8217;old Hall. Yü&#8217;m to be
under-gardener there I heerd t&#8217;Doctor say. What
they&#8217;ll want wi&#8217; keeping up t&#8217;gardens now I doant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
knoaw, and t&#8217;old Squire gone. Carried off mighty
suddint &#8217;e was. Us said as t&#8217;journey tü Lunnon ud
be the death o&#8217; he. Never outside t&#8217;doors these
fifteen year and more, and then one fine day
Doctor takes he oop to Lunnon to see one o&#8217; they
chaps un calls a speshulist. Why t&#8217;speshulist
didn&#8217;t come to he us can&#8217;t tell. Carried on a
stretcher he was from t&#8217;carriage to t&#8217;train, for all
the world like a covered corpse. Next thing Doctor
coom home alone, and us hears as t&#8217;old Squire be
dead. I doant rightly knoaw as who &#8217;twas was the
first to tell we, for Doctor, &#8217;e doant like talking o&#8217;
the business. But there &#8217;tis, and t&#8217;Lord only
knows who&#8217;ll have t&#8217;old place now, seeing as &#8217;ow
&#8217;e never &#8217;ad no wife to bear un a son. Us <i>heerd</i> as
&#8217;twould be a chap from foreign parts. &#8217;Twas Jane
Ellen from Doctor&#8217;s as put that around, but us
thinks her got the notion in a way her shouldn&#8217;t,
for her&#8217;s backed out o&#8217; the sayin&#8217; o&#8217;t now. Says
her never said nowt o&#8217; the kind. But her did.
&#8217;Twas Jim Morris&#8217;s wife her told. S&#8217;pose Mr.
Curtis&#8217;ll run t&#8217;show till t&#8217;heir turns oop. &#8217;Twont
make much difference to we. He&#8217;s run it the last
ten year and more, and run it <i>hard</i>, I tell &#8217;ee that.
Doant yü go for to get the wrong side o&#8217; Spencer
Curtis, I warns &#8217;ee. George Standing afore &#8217;e
worn&#8217;t much to boast on, but Spencer Curtis be a
fair flint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he be the agent?&#8221; demanded Antony, as
the man paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis what &#8217;e&#8217;s <i>called</i>. &#8217;Tis master he <i>is</i>. T&#8217;old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
Squire oughtn&#8217;t never to have got a chap like &#8217;e to
do &#8217;is jobs. &#8217;Tis cast iron &#8217;e is. And &#8217;twasn&#8217;t never
no use going to Squire for to stand between him and
we. &#8217;E&#8217;d never set eyes on nobody, &#8217;e wouldn&#8217;t. If
I&#8217;d my way I&#8217;d give every gentry what owns
property a taste o&#8217; livin&#8217; on it same&#8217;s we. &#8217;E&#8217;d
know a bit more aboot the fair runnin&#8217; o&#8217; it then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony started. An idea, quick-born, presented
itself before him. Was it possible, was it conceivable,
that this very thought had been in the
old Squire&#8217;s mind when he drew up those extraordinary
conditions? Antony nearly laughed
aloud. Verily it was an absurdity, though one
that Nicholas Danver most assuredly could not
have guessed. Yet that he&mdash;Antony&mdash;should
require a further year&#8217;s enlightenment as to the
shifts to which the poor were put to make both
ends meet, as to the iron hand of agents and over-seers!
Truly it was laughable!</p>
<p>He&#8217;d had experience enough and to spare,&mdash;he
smiled grimly to himself,&mdash;experience such as an
English farm-labourer earning a pound a week, even
with a wife and children to keep, and all odds against
him, could never in the remotest degree aided
by the wildest flights of imagination, conceive.
In England water at least is always obtainable.
Antony had visions of the jealous husbanding
of a few drops of hot moisture in a sunbaked
leather bottle. In England the law at least protects
you from bodily ill-treatment at the hands
of agent or overseer. Antony had visions&mdash;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
he dismissed them. There was a chapter or two in
his life which it was not good to recall.</p>
<p>They were descending now, driving between the
high banks and hedges of a true Devonshire lane.
Primroses starred the banks, though in less profusion
than they had been a fortnight earlier; bluebells
and pink campion grew among them, and the
feathery blossom of the cow-parsley. Turning to
the left at the foot of the lane, the hedge on the
right was lower. Over it, and across an expanse
of sloping fields dotted here and there with snow-white
hawthorn bushes, Antony saw the roofs of
houses and cottages, and, beyond them, the sea.
It lay grey and tranquil under an equally grey sky.
A solitary fishing smack, red-sailed, made a note of
colour in the neutral atmosphere of sea and sky.
To the right was a gorse-crowned cliff; to the
left, and across the estuary, a headland ran far
out into the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Byestry,&#8221; said the man, nodding in the direction
of the roofs. &#8220;Us doant go down into t&#8217;place.
Yü&#8217;m to have Widow Jenkins&#8217;s cottage, her as died
back tü Christmas. &#8217;Tis a quarter o&#8217;mile or so
from t&#8217;town, and &#8217;twill be that mooch nearer
t&#8217;old Hall. Yü see yon chimbleys by they three
elms yonder? &#8217;Tis Doctor&#8217;s house. Yü&#8217;m tü go
there this evenin&#8217; aboot seven o&#8217;clock &#8217;e bid me
tell &#8217;ee. Where was yü working tü last?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question came abruptly. For one brief
second Antony was non-plussed. Then he recovered
himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis London I&#8217;ve just come from,&#8221; he replied
airily enough. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing a bit on my own
account lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;I reckon if I&#8217;d
been workin&#8217; my own jobs, I&#8217;d not take an under
post in a hurry. But yü knoaws your own business
best. T&#8217;last chap as was underest gardener
oop tü t&#8217;Hall got took on by folks living over
Exeter way. He boarded wi&#8217; t&#8217;blacksmith and
his wife. Maybe yü&#8217;m a married man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; said Antony smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not got a maid at all?&#8221; queried the other.</p>
<p>Antony shook his head.</p>
<p>The man opened his eyes. &#8220;Lord love &#8217;ee,
what do un want wi&#8217; a cottage, then! Yü&#8217;d best be
takin&#8217; oop wi&#8217; a wife. There&#8217;s a sight of vitty maids
tü Byestry, and &#8217;tis lonesome like comin&#8217; home to
an empty hearth and no supper. There&#8217;s Rose
Darell, her&#8217;s a güd maid, and has a bit o&#8217; money;
or Jenny Horswell, her&#8217;s a bit o&#8217; a squint, but is a
fair vitty maid tü t&#8217;cleanin&#8217;; or Vicky Mathers,
her&#8217;s as pretty as a picter, but her&#8217;s not the money
nor the house ways o&#8217; Rose or Jenny,&#8221; he ended
with thoughtful consideration.</p>
<p>Antony laughed, despite the fact that inwardly
he was not a trifle dismayed. He had no mind
to have the belles of Byestry thus paraded
for his choice. Work, he had accepted with
the conditions, but a wife was a very different
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m not a marryin&#8217; man at all, I am not,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
he responded, a hypocritical sigh succeeding to the
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crossed?&#8221; queried the man. &#8220;Ah, well,
doan&#8217;t &#8217;ee go for to get down on your luck for one
maid. There&#8217;s as güd blackberries hangin&#8217; on
t&#8217;bushes as ever was plucked from them. And
yü&#8217;m tü young a chap tü be thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; yürself as a
sallybat, and so I tells &#8217;ee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony smothered a spasm of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not women folk I&#8217;m wanting in my life,&#8221;
responded he, still with hypocritical gloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tis kittle cattle they be, and that&#8217;s sartain,
sure,&#8221; replied the other, shaking his head. &#8220;But
&#8217;twas a rib out o&#8217; the side o&#8217; Adam the first woman
was, so t&#8217;Scripture do tell we, and I reckon us men
folk do feel the lack o&#8217; that rib nowadays, till us
gets us a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony was spared an answer, a fact for which
he sent up devout thanks. They had made another
leftward turn by now, and come upon a
cottage set a little way back from the road,&mdash;a
cottage with a wicket gate between two hedges,
and a flagged path leading up to a small porch,
thatched, as was the cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here us be,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>Antony&#8217;s heart gave a sudden big throb of pleasure.
The little place was so extraordinarily
English, so primitive and quaint. True, the garden
was a bit dilapidated looking, the apple trees
in the tiny orchard to the left of the cottage quite
amazingly old and lichen grown; but it spelled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
England for him, and that more emphatically
than any other thing had done since his arrival in
the Old Country.</p>
<p>Antony dismounted from the trap, then lifted
Josephus and his bag to the ground. This done,
he began to feel in his pocket for some coins. The
man saw the movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;That bain&#8217;t for yü,&#8221; he replied shortly, &#8220;t&#8217;
Doctor will settle wi&#8217; I.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Antony withdrew his hand quickly, feeling
he had been on the verge of a lapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s t&#8217;key,&#8221; remarked the man. &#8220;And if
yü feel like a pipe one o&#8217; these evenin&#8217;s, yü might
coom down tü t&#8217;village. My place is over opposite
t&#8217;post office. I be t&#8217;saddler. Yü&#8217;ll see t&#8217;name
Allbut George over t&#8217;shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony thanked Mr. Albert George, and then
watched the patriotically named gentleman turn
his horse, and drive off in the direction of the
coast. When the trap had vanished from sight, he
heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Josephus,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;it will need careful
practice and wary walking, but I fancy I did
pretty well.&#8221; And then he opened the garden
gate.</p>
<p>He walked up the little path, and fitted the
key with which Allbut George had provided him,
into the lock. He turned it, and pushed open the
door. It gave at once into a small but cheerful
room, brick-floored, with a big fireplace at one
side. An oak settle stood by the fireplace; a low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
seat, covered with a somewhat faded dimity, was
before the window; there was a basket-chair, two
wooden chairs, a round table, a dresser with some
highly coloured earthenware crockery on it, a corner
cupboard, and a grandfather&#8217;s clock. There
was a door behind the settle to the right of the
fireplace, and, in the opposite corner, stairs
leading to a room or rooms above.</p>
<p>Antony put his bag down on the table and went
to investigate the door. It led into a tiny scullery
or kitchen, provided solely with a small range, a
deal table, a chair, a sink, and a pump. In one
corner was a box containing some pieces of wood.
In another corner was a galvanized bucket, a broom,
and a scrubbing-brush. He glanced around, then
came back into the sitting-room, and made his
way to the stairs.</p>
<p>They led direct into a bedroom, a place furnished
with a camp bed covered with a red and
brown striped blanket; a small, somewhat rickety
oak chest of drawers, a rush-bottomed chair, a
small table, a corner washstand, and a curtain,
which hid pegs driven into the wall. A door led
into a small inner room over the kitchen scullery.
Antony opened the door. The room was empty.
Widow Jenkins had had no use for it, it would
appear. Or, so Antony suddenly thought, perhaps
all Widow Jenkins&#8217;s furniture had been removed,
and what at present occupied the place had
been put there solely on his account.</p>
<p>He crossed to the window, and pushed it back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
It looked on to a tiny vegetable garden, in much
the same state of neglect as the front garden, and
was separated from a field yellow with buttercups
by a low hawthorn hedge. Beyond the field was
a tiny brook; and, beyond that again, a copse.
There was not a sound to break the silence, save
the dripping of the rain from the roof of the cottage,
and, in the distance, the low sighing note of the
sea. The silence was emphasized by the fact that
for the last week Antony had had the hum of
traffic in his ears, and had but this moment come
from the noise of trains and the rattle of a shaky
dog-cart.</p>
<p>He still leaned there looking out. It was
even more silent than the veldt. There were no
little strange animal noises to break the silence.
Nothing but that drip, drip of the rain, and that
soft distant sighing of the sea.</p>
<p>A curious sense of loneliness fell upon him, a
loneliness altogether at variance with the loneliness
of the veldt. He could not have defined wherein
the difference lay, yet he was well aware that there
was a difference. It was one of those subtle
differences, exceedingly apparent to the inner
consciousness, yet entirely impossible to translate
into terms of speech. The nearest approach he
could get to anything like a definition of it, was
that it was less big, but more definitely poignant.
Beyond that he did not, or could not, go. For
some five minutes or so he leant at the little casement
window, gazing at the gold of the buttercups
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
seen through a blurred mist of rain. Then he pulled
the window to, and came down into the parlour.</p>
<p>The hands of the grandfather&#8217;s clock pointed to
ten minutes to five. Antony, remembering the
box of wood in the scullery, bethought himself of a
cup of tea. His bag contained all the requirements.
Long practice had taught him to provide
himself with necessities, and also, on occasions, to
substitute lemon for milk, as a complement to tea.</p>
<p>He was just about to go and fetch a handful of
sticks, preparatory to lighting a fire, when he
heard the click of his garden gate. Turning,
and looking through the window, he saw a big man
coming up the path.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>DOUBTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Doctor Hilary was returning from his rounds.
His state of mind was nearly as grey as the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It is one thing to agree to a mad-brained scheme
in the first amused interest of its propounding,
even to mould it further, and bring it into shape.
It is quite another to be actually confronted with
the finished scheme, to realize that, though you
may not be its veritable parent, you have at all
events foster-fathered it quite considerably, and
that, moreover, you cannot now, in conscience,
cast off responsibility in its behalf.</p>
<p>The fact that you had excellent reasons for
adopting the scheme in the first place, will doubtless
be of comfort to your soul, but that particular
species of comfort and ordinary everyday common
sense are not always as closely united as you
might desire. In fact they are occasionally apt to
pull in entirely opposite directions, a method of
procedure which is far from consoling.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary found it far from consoling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>Conscience told him quite plainly that his real
and innermost reason for foster-fathering the
scheme was simply and solely for the sake of snatching
at any mortal thing that would, or could, bring
interest into an old man&#8217;s life. Common sense
demanded why on earth he had not suggested an
alternative idea, something a trifle less mad. And
it was mad. There did not now appear one single
reasonable point in it, though very assuredly there
were quite a vast number of unreasonable ones.</p>
<p>In the first place, and it seemed to him nearly,
if not quite, the most unreasonable point, Nicholas
had known nothing whatever about the young man
he had elected to make his heir,&mdash;nothing, that is,
beyond the fact that he had known the young
man&#8217;s father, and had once seen Antony himself
when Antony was a child. There had even been
very considerable difficulty in obtaining knowledge
of his whereabouts.</p>
<p>In the second place, it appeared quite absurd to
appoint the young man to the position of under-gardener
at the Hall. It was more than probable that
he knew nothing whatever about gardening. It was
true that, if he did not, he could learn. But then
Golding, the head gardener, might not unreasonably
find matter for amazement and comment in
the fact that a young and ignorant man, who was
paid a pound a week and allowed to rent a furnished
cottage, should be thrust upon him, rather than an
experienced man, or an ignorant boy who would
have received at the most eight shillings a week,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
and have lived at his own home. Amazement and
comment were to be avoided, that had been Nicholas&#8217;s
idea, and yet, to Doctor Hilary&#8217;s mind they
ran the risk of being courted from the outset. In
the third place, how was it likely that a man
of education&mdash;and it had been ascertained that
Antony was a university man&mdash;could comport
himself like a labourer in any position,&mdash;gardener,
farm-hand, or chauffeur? The conditions had
stated that he was to do so. But could he?
There was the point.</p>
<p>The more Doctor Hilary thought about the
conditions, the madder they appeared to him.
Yet, having undertaken the job of carrying the
mad scheme through, he could not possibly back
out at the eleventh hour. He could only hope for
the best, but it must be confessed that he was
not exceedingly optimistic about that best. And
further, he was not exceedingly optimistic about
the young man. He could imagine himself, in a
like situation, consigning Nick and his conditions
to the nether regions; certainly not submitting
meekly to a year&#8217;s effacement of his personality
for the sake of money. Such conditions would
have enraged him.</p>
<p>No; he was not optimistic regarding the man.
He pictured him as either a bit of a fawner, who
would cringe through the year, or a keen-headed
business man, who would go through it with a steel-trap
mouth, and an eye to every weakness in his
fellow-workers. Certainly neither type he pictured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
appealed to him. Yet he felt confident he
would find one of the two, and had already conceived
a strong prejudice against Antony Gray.
From which regrettable fact it will be seen that he
was committing the sin of rash judgment.</p>
<p>It was not altogether surprising, therefore,
that his mood was nearly as grey as the atmosphere.</p>
<p>He sighed heavily, and shook his head, somewhat
after the fashion of a big dog. Reasons,
partly mental, partly physical were responsible
for the shake. In the first place it was an attempt
to dispel mental depression; in the second place
it was to free his eyebrows and eyelashes from the
rain drops clinging to them, since the rain was
descending in a grey misty veil.</p>
<p>With the shake, an idea struck him.</p>
<p>Why not confront the embodied scheme at once?
Why not interview this preposterous young man
without delay, and be done with it?</p>
<p>He gave a brief direction to his coachman.</p>
<p>Five minutes later saw him standing at the gate
of Copse Cottage, his dog-cart driving away down
the lane. It had been his own doing. He had
said he would walk home. An idiotic idea! What
on earth had suggested it to him?</p>
<p>However, it was done now.</p>
<p>He pushed open the gate, and walked up the
little flagged path.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>CONCERNING MICHAEL FIELD</h3>
</div>

<p>Antony, having seen a figure approaching the
door, opened it, and confronted a big, rugged-faced
man, who looked at him somewhat grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Field?&#8221; demanded the big man briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis my name,&#8221; he replied cheerfully.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be Doctor Hilary, I&#8217;m thinking. Won&#8217;t
you be coming in out of the wet.&#8221; He flung wide
the door on the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;George found you all right?&#8221; queried Doctor
Hilary stepping across the threshold. He appeared
totally oblivious of the fact that Antony&#8217;s
presence made the success of George&#8217;s search
fairly obvious.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did that,&#8221; returned Antony pushing forward
a chair, but making no attempt to sit down
himself. The impulse had been upon him. Memory
had awakened just in time.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary was silent. The reality was so
entirely different from his preconceived notions.
The cheerful, clean-shaven young man, with the
Irish accent, standing before him in an attitude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
of quite respectful, but not in the least subservient
attention, was at such complete variance with
either of his two imaginary types, that he found
his attitude of grimness insensibly relaxing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did George speak to you regarding your
work?&#8221; he demanded suddenly. He couldn&#8217;t for
the life of him, think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned Antony thoughtfully considering,
&#8220;he asked me about my last place, and I told
him I&#8217;d been working on my own account. Thereupon
he expressed surprise that I should now be
taking an under post, but remarked with vast
wisdom that every man knew his own business
best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; said Doctor Hilary.</p>
<p>&#8220;He also,&#8221; continued Antony, his eyes twinkling,
&#8220;was for giving me advice on matrimony, and
mentioned three &#8216;vitty maids&#8217; he could produce for
my inspection. I told him,&#8221; continued Antony
solemnly, though his eyes were still twinkling,
&#8220;that I was not a marrying man at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary found the twinkle in Antony&#8217;s
eyes gaining response in his own. He was such a
remarkably cheerful young man, and so confiding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; he remarked again. &#8220;He said nothing
else I suppose? Expressed no surprise at
your being chosen for the post, instead of a local
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not,&#8221; responded Antony, replying
to the last question. &#8220;It would seem that he
thought any appointment to the post unnecessary,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
in view of the fact that the Hall was at present
untenanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you replied&mdash;?&#8221; asked Doctor Hilary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I had no opinion to offer,&#8221; said Antony.
&#8220;It was not my affair at all. He talked, but I
said little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good principle,&#8221; remarked Doctor Hilary
approvingly, &#8220;and one I should advise you to
adhere to. Your accent is all right, but your&mdash;your
speech is a trifle fluent, if I may make the
suggestion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony laughed pleasantly. He was now made
sure of the fact of which he had been already tolerably
certain, namely, that this big, rugged-faced
man was fully aware of the conditions of the will,
and his own identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis we Irish have the gift o&#8217; the gab,&#8221;
he returned apologetically, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll be remembering
your advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little silence. It was broken by
Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was for making a cup of tea when you came
up the path, sor. Will you be having one with me?
It&#8217;ll not take beyont ten minutes or so to get a fire
going, and the water boiling. That is, if you&#8217;ll be
doing me the honour, sor,&#8221; he concluded gravely.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary laughed outright.</p>
<p>He watched Antony disappear into the scullery,
to reappear with a bundle of sticks and a log. He
watched him kneeling by the fire, manipulating
them deftly. He watched him fill a kettle with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
water, and put it on the fire, set cups on the table,
then open his bag, and produce bread, butter, a
packet of tea, and a lemon.</p>
<p>It was extraordinary what an alteration his
sentiments had undergone since entering Copse
Cottage. Every trace of prejudice had vanished.
There was, in his mind, something pathetic in the
skill, evidently born of long practice, with which
this tall lean man made his preparations for the
little meal.</p>
<p>From watching the man, Doctor Hilary turned
his attention to the room. It was fairly comfortable,
at all events, if not in the least luxurious.
But the inevitable loneliness of the life that would
be led within its walls, struck him with a curious
forcefulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know anything of gardening?&#8221; he
demanded suddenly, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s little I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned Antony.
&#8220;&#8217;Twas a bit of wild earth my garden was before
I took it in hand. Now there&#8217;s peach trees, and
nectarines, and plum trees in it, and all the vegetables
any man could be wanting, and flowers fit
for a queen&#8217;s drawing-room. There&#8217;s roses as big
as your fist. Oh, &#8217;tis a fine garden it is out on&mdash;&#8221;
he broke off, &#8220;out beyont,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the veldt,&#8221; suggested Doctor Hilary
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas the veldt I was after meaning,&#8221; responded
Antony smiling, &#8220;but I thought &#8217;twould be
as well to get my tongue used to forgetting the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
sound of the word, lest it should slip out some fine
day, when I wasn&#8217;t meaning it to at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wise, anyhow,&#8221; agreed Doctor Hilary, and he
too smiled. &#8220;But you understand that I&mdash;well, I
happen to know all the circumstances of this
arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony laughed. &#8220;I was thinking as much,&#8221;
he confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder&mdash;&#8221; began Doctor Hilary. And
then he stopped. He had been about to wonder
aloud as to why on earth Antony should have
accepted the conditions, why he should have exchanged
the freedom and untrammelled spaces
of the veldt for the conventional life of England,
even with the Hall and a goodly income, at the
end of the year, to the balance. He knew most
assuredly that nine hundred and ninety-nine men
out of a thousand would have done so, and he
knew that he himself was the thousandth who
would not. His exceedingly brief acquaintance
with Antony had given him the impression that
he, also, was a thousandth man.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonder&mdash;?&#8221; queried Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how you&#8217;ll like the life,&#8221; said Doctor
Hilary, though it was not precisely what he had
originally intended to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis England,&#8221; said Antony briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your sole reason for accepting the
life?&#8221; asked Doctor Hilary curiously.</p>
<p>Antony looked him full in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not,&#8221; he replied smiling. And then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
he turned to the kettle, which was on the point of
boiling over.</p>
<p>Of course it was a rebuff. But it was a perfectly
polite one. And oddly&mdash;or, perhaps, not oddly&mdash;Doctor
Hilary did not resent it in the least. On
the contrary, he respected the man who had
administered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no milk,&#8221; said Antony presently,
pouring tea into two cups. &#8220;Can you be putting
up with a lemon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like it,&#8221; Doctor Hilary assured him.</p>
<p>After the meal they smoked together, making
remarks now and again, interspersed with little
odd silences, which, however, appeared quite
natural and friendly. Josephus, who at the outset
had viewed the entry of the big man on the scene
with something akin to disapproval, now walked
solemnly over to him, stood on his hind legs, and
put his fore paws on Doctor Hilary&#8217;s knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;A token of approval,&#8221; said Antony.</p>
<p>And then another of the odd little silences
fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will report yourself to Golding at half-past
seven on Monday morning,&#8221; said Doctor
Hilary some quarter of an hour later, as he rose to
take his leave. &#8220;He lives at the lodge about five
minutes&#8217; walk up the road. You&#8217;ll find the place
all right. You will take all instructions as to your
work from him. If you should wish to see me
personally at any time regarding anything, you will
usually find me at home in the evening.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Antony touched his forehead in the most
approved style.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, sor,&#8221; he responded.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary smiled. &#8220;Well, good luck to
you. It will be better&mdash;of course, from now
onward, we must remember that you are Michael
Field, under-gardener at the Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a good name,&#8221; said Antony solemnly.
&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m downright obliged to me godfathers
and godmothers for giving me such a one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Doctor Hilary smiled. &#8220;Oh, and by
the way,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how about money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony felt in his pockets. He produced two
florins, a sixpence, and a halfpenny. He looked
at them lying in the palm of his hand. Then he
looked whimsically at the Doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether the possession of these
coins breaks the spirit of the contract. I&#8217;m thinking
&#8217;twill hardly break the letter. &#8217;Tis all I
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Doctor laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy not,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;d better give
you your first week&#8217;s wage in advance. You&#8217;ll
need to lay in provisions. There&#8217;s a general store
in Byestry. Perhaps you&#8217;ll want to do a little
in the purchasing line. Remember, to-morrow is
Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laid a sovereign on the table, and a moment
later the garden gate clicked to behind him.</p>
<p>Antony went back into the little parlour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>

<p>The morning broke as fair, as blue-skied,
as sunny, as the previous day had been gloomy,
grey-skied, and wet.</p>
<p>The song of a golden-throated lark was the
first sound that Antony heard, as he woke to find
the early morning sunshine pouring through the
open casement window. He lay very still, listening
to the flood of liquid notes, and looking at
the square of blue sky, seen through the window.
Now and again an ivy leaf tapped gently at the
pane, stirred by a little breeze blowing from the
sea, and sweeping softly across buttercupped
meadow and gorse-grown moorland. Once a flight
of rooks passed across the square blue patch, and
once a pigeon lighted for an instant on the windowsill,
to fly off again on swift, strong wings.</p>
<p>He lay there, drowsily content. For that day
at least, there was a pleasant idleness ahead of
him, nothing but his own wants to attend to. The
morrow would see him armed with spade and rake,
probably wrestling with weeds, digging deep in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
the good brown earth, possibly mowing the grass,
and such like jobs as fall to the lot of an under-gardener.
Antony smiled to himself. Well, it
would all come in the day&#8217;s work, and the day&#8217;s
work would be no novel master to him. The open
air, whether under cloud or sunshine, was good.
After all, his lot for the year would not be such
a bad one. He was in the mood to echo the
praises of that brown-feathered morsel pouring
forth its lauds somewhere aloft in the blue.
Suddenly the song ceased. The bird had come
to earth.</p>
<p>For a moment or so longer Antony lay very
still, listening to the silence. Then he flung
back the bed-clothes, went to the window, and
looked out.</p>
<p>He looked across the tiny garden, and the
lane, to a wild-rose hedge; fragile pink blossoms
swayed gently in the breeze. Beyond the hedge
was a field of close-cropped grass, dotted here and
there with sheep. To the left a turn in the lane,
and the high banks and hedges, shut further view
from sight. To the right, and far below the cottage,
across meadows and the hidden village of
Byestry, lay the sea.</p>
<p>It lay blue and sparkling, flecked with a myriad
moving specks of gold, as the sunshine fell on
the dancing water. He had seen it at close quarters
last night, from the little quay, seen it smooth
and grey, its breast heaving now and then as if in
gentle sleep. To-day it was awake, alive, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
buoyant. He must get down to it again. It was
inviting him, smiling, dimpling, alluring.</p>
<p>He made a quick but exceedingly careful toilet.
Antony was fastidious to a degree in the matter
of cleanliness. Earth dirt he had no objection
to; slovenly dirt was as abhorrent to him as vice.</p>
<p>Josephus, who had slept in the parlour, accorded
him a hearty welcome on his descent of the narrow
steep little stairs, intimating that he was every
whit as ready to be up and doing as was his
master. The sunshine, the blithesomeness of the
morning was infectious. You felt yourself smiling
in accord with its smiles.</p>
<p>Antony flung wide the cottage door. A scent
of rosemary, southernwood, and verbena was
wafted to him from the little garden,&mdash;clean, old-fashioned
scents, English in their very essence.
Anon he had more commonplace scents mingling
with them,&mdash;the appetizing smell of fried sausages,
the aromatic odour of freshly made coffee. Josephus
found himself in two minds as to the respective
merits of the attractions without, and the
alluring odours within. Finally, after one scamper
round the garden, he compromised by seating
himself on the doorstep, for the most part facing
the sunshine, but now and again turning a wet
black nose in the direction of the breakfast table
and frying-pan.</p>
<p>An hour or so later he was giving himself wholeheartedly
to the grassy and rabbitty scents dear
to a doggy soul, as he scampered in the direction of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Byestry with his master. Occasionally he made
side tracks into hedges and down rabbit holes,
whence at a whistle from Antony, he would emerge
innocent in expression, but utterly condemned by
traces of red earth on his black nose and white
back.</p>
<p>There was a lazy Sundayish atmosphere about
the village as Antony passed through it, with
Josephus now at his heels. Men lounged by
cottage doors, women gossiped across garden
fences. The only beings with an object in
view appeared to be children,&mdash;crimp-haired little
girls, and stiffly-suited small boys, who walked
in chattering groups in the direction of a building
he rightly judged to be a Sunday-school.</p>
<p>A little farther on, a priest was standing by
the door of a small barn-like-looking place with a
cross at one end. Antony vaguely supposed it to
be a church, and thought, also vaguely, that it
was the oddest-looking one he had ever seen. He
concluded that Byestry was too small to boast
a larger edifice.</p>
<p>On reaching the quay he turned to the right,
walking along a cobbled pavement, which presently
sloped down to the beach and a narrow
stretch of firm smooth sand, bordered by brown
rocks and the sea on one side, and a towering cliff
on the other. The tide was going down, leaving
the brown rocks uncovered. Among them were
small crystal pools, reflecting the blue of the
sky as in a mirror. Sea spleenwort and masses of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
samphire grew on the cliffs to his right. No danger
here to the would-be samphire gatherer; it
could be plucked from the safety of solid earth, with
as great ease as picking up shells from the beach.</p>
<p>After some half hour&#8217;s walking, Antony turned
a corner, bringing him to a yet lonelier beach.
Looking back, he found Byestry shut from his
view,&mdash;the cliffs behind him, the sea before him,
the sky above him, stretches of sand around him,
and himself alone, save for Josephus, and sea-gulls
which dipped to the water or circled in the blue,
and jackdaws which cried harshly from the cliffs.</p>
<p>He sat down on the sand, and began to fill
his pipe. It was extraordinarily lonely, extraordinarily
peaceful. There was no sinister note
in the loneliness such as he had experienced in the
vast spaces of the African veldt, but a reposefulness,
a quiet rest which appealed to him. The
very blueness of the sky and sparkle of the sunshine
was tender after the brazen glitter of the
African sun. Turning to look behind him, he
saw that here the cliff was grass-covered, sloping
almost to the beach, and among the grass, hiding
its green, were countless bluebells, a sheet of
shimmering colour. Two lines of Tennyson&#8217;s
came suddenly into his mind.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>The island of flowers and the island of silence
in one, he felt the place to be, and no fear of fighting,
with himself as sole inhabitant. So might the
islands have been after Maeldune had renounced
his purpose of revenge, after he had returned from
the isle of the saint who had spoken words of peace.</p>
<p>He lost count of time. A pleasant waking
drowsiness fell upon him, till at length, seeing
that the sun had reached its zenith, he realized
that it must be noon, and began to consider the
advisability of retracing his steps.</p>
<p>He got to his feet, whistling to a white speck
in the distance, which he rightly judged to be
Josephus, and set out on his homeward route.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The village appeared deserted, as he once more
reached it. Doubtless the Sunday dinner, which
accounts so largely for Sunday sleepiness, was
in progress.</p>
<p>Coming to the small barn-like-looking building
which he had noticed earlier in the morning, and
seeing that the door was open, he looked in. The
air was heavy with the scent of incense. It
needed only a moment&#8217;s observation to tell him
that he was in a Catholic church. A curtained
tabernacle stood on the little altar, before which
hung a ruby lamp. The building was too small to
allow of two altars, but at one side was a statue of
Our Lady, the base surrounded with flowers, since
it was the month of May. Near the porch was a
statue of St. Peter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>Antony looked curiously around. It was the
third time only that he had entered a Catholic
church, the second time being at Teneriffe with
the Duchessa. Ordering Josephus to stay without,
he walked up the little aisle, and sat
down in one of the rush-seated chairs near the
sanctuary. He hadn&#8217;t a notion what prompted
the impulse, but he knew that some impulse was
at work.</p>
<p>He looked towards the sanctuary. Mass had
been said not long since, and the chalice covered
with the veil and burse was still on the altar.
Antony hadn&#8217;t a notion of even the first principles
of the Catholic faith, not as much as the smallest
Catholic child; but he felt here, in a measure,
the same sense of home as he knew the Duchessa
to have felt in the church at Teneriffe. Oddly
enough he did not feel himself the least an intruder.
There was almost a sense of welcome.</p>
<p>From looking at the altar he looked at the chairs,
and the small oblong pieces of pasteboard fastened
to their backs. He looked down at the piece
which denoted the owner of the chair in which
he was sitting. And then he found himself staring
at it, while his heart leaped and thumped madly.
On the pasteboard four words were written,&mdash;The
Duchessa di Donatello.</p>
<p>He gazed at the words hardly able to believe
the sight of his own eyes. What odd coincidence,
what odd impulse had brought him to her very
chair? It was extraordinary, unbelievable almost.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
And then another thought flashed into his brain,
making his heart stand still.</p>
<p>A door to the left opened, and a priest came
out. He looked momentarily at Antony, then
went into the sanctuary, genuflected, took the
covered chalice from the altar, genuflected again,
and went back into the sacristy, leaving the door
partly open.</p>
<p>Antony got suddenly to his feet. He went
towards the sacristy. The priest, hearing the
sound of steps, opened the door wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said Antony, &#8220;but can you tell
me where Woodleigh is?&#8221; His Irish brogue
was forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied the priest. &#8220;It is about
two miles from here, inland.&#8221; He looked rather
curiously at the man, who, though labourer by his
dress, yet spoke in an obviously refined voice.
He waited, perhaps expecting some further
question.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all I wanted to know,&#8221; said Antony.
&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; He turned back into the church.</p>
<p>Father Dormer looked after him. There was
a puzzled look in his eye.</p>
<p>Antony came out of the church and into the
sunlight. He called to Josephus, who was busy
with the investigation of a distant smithy, and
turned up the street, walking rather quickly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>HONOR VINCIT</h3>
</div>

<p>His brain was working rapidly, the while he
felt a curious leaden sensation at his heart. He
had never even contemplated the possibility of
the Duchessa living in the neighbourhood, though
he now marvelled why he had never happened to
question her as to the exact locality of Woodleigh.</p>
<p>Of course he knew, and assured himself that
he knew, that the chances were all against any
probability of their meeting. How was it likely
they should meet, seeing that she was a <i>grande
dame</i>, and he merely an under-gardener at the
Hall? Of course it was not probable. Nevertheless
there was just the faintest chance. He
couldn&#8217;t deny that remote chance. And if they
did meet, and she should recognize him?&mdash;There
was the question.</p>
<p>Explanation would be impossible in view of his
promise. And what would she think? Wouldn&#8217;t
it be conceivable, nay, wouldn&#8217;t it be natural that
she should be indignant at the thought that she
had admitted to her friendship a man, who, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
her eyes, would appear one of inferior birth?
Wouldn&#8217;t his behaviour on the <i>Fort Salisbury</i>
appear to her in the light of a fraud? Wouldn&#8217;t
his letter appear to her as a piece of preposterous
presumption on his part? How could it be expected
that she should see beneath the surface
of things as they seemed to be, and solve the
riddle of appearances? It was such an inconceivable
situation, such an altogether unheard
of situation, laughable too, if it weren&#8217;t for the
vague possibility of the&mdash;to him&mdash;tragedy he now
saw involved in it. It was this, this vague sense
of tragedy, that was causing that leaden sensation
at his heart.</p>
<p>He tried to tell himself that he was being morbid,
that he ran no possible risk of coming face to
face with the Duchessa, in spite of the fact that
the Manor House Woodleigh lay but two miles
distant. But the assurances he heaped upon his
soul, went a remarkably small way towards
cheering it.</p>
<p>And yet, through the leadenness upon his soul,
through that vague, almost indefinable sense of
tragedy at hand, ran a curious little note of
exultation. Though he had no smallest desire
for her to set eyes on him, might not he set eyes on
her? And yet, if he did, would the joy in the
sight be worth the dull ache, the horrible sense
of isolation in the knowledge that word with
her was forbidden.</p>
<p>He realized now, for the first time in its fullest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
measure, what her advent into his life meant
to him. Bodily separation for a year had been
possible to contemplate. Even should it extend
to a lifetime, he would still have three golden
weeks of memory to his comfort. But should
mental separation fall upon him, should it ever be
his lot to read anger in her eyes, he felt that his
very soul would die. Even memory would be lost
to him, by reason of the unbearable pain it would
hold. And then, with the characteristics of a
man accustomed to face possibilities, to confront
contingencies and emergencies beforehand, he saw
himself face to face with a temptation. Should
the emergency he contemplated arise, was there
not a simple solution of it? She was quick-witted,
she might quite conceivably guess at the existence
of some riddle. Would not the tiniest hint
suffice for her? The merest possible inflection of
his voice?</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>He had reached his cottage by now. He went
in and shut the door.</p>
<p>He sat down on the oak settle, staring at the
little casement window opposite to him, without
seeing it. It appeared to him that there were
voices talking within his brain or soul,&mdash;he didn&#8217;t
know which,&mdash;while he himself was answering one
of them&mdash;the loudest.</p>
<p>The loudest voice spoke quite cheerfully, and
was full of common sense. It urged him to abandon
the consideration of the whole matter for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
present; it told him that the probability of his
meeting the Duchessa was so extraordinarily
remote, that it was not worth while torturing his
mind with considerations of what line of action he
would take should the emergency arise. Should it
do so, he could act then as his conscience prompted.</p>
<p>He found himself replying to this voice, speaking
almost stubbornly. He had got to fight the matter
out now, he declared. He had got to decide
absolutely definitely what course of action he intended
to pursue, should the emergency he feared
arise. He was not going to leave matters to chance
and be surprised into saying or doing something
he might either way afterwards regret. He knew
the danger of not making up his mind beforehand.
To which the loud voice responded with something
like a sneer, telling him to have it his own way.
And then it remained mockingly silent, while
another and more insidious voice began to speak.</p>
<p>The insidious voice told him quite gently that
this emergency might indeed arise; it pointed out
to him the quite conceivable events that might
occur from it; it assured him that it had no possible
desire that he should break his promise in any
way. He was not to dream of giving any explanation
to the Duchessa, but that he would owe it to
himself, <i>and to her</i>, to give her the faintest hint that
at a future date he <i>could</i> give her an explanation.
That was all. There would be no breaking of
his promise. She could not possibly even guess
at what that explanation might be. She would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
merely realize that <i>something</i> underlay the present
appearances.</p>
<p>The proposition sounded perfectly reasonable,
perfectly just. His own common sense told him
that there could be no harm in it. It was the
rightful solution of the difficulty, arrived at by
silencing that first loud voice,&mdash;the voice which
had clearly wished him to abandon all consideration
of the matter, that he might be surprised
into giving a full explanation of the situation.</p>
<p>Antony drew a long breath of relief.</p>
<p>After all, he had been torturing himself needlessly.
She herself had spoken of trust. Should
that trust totter for an instant, would not the
faintest possible hint be sufficient to re-establish it
on a firm basis?</p>
<p>With the thought, the little square of casement
window came back once more to his vision. He
saw through it an old-fashioned rose bush of
crimson roses in the garden; he heard a bird twitter,
and call to its mate. The abnormal had
vanished, reduced itself once more to plain wholesome
common sense. And then suddenly, and
without warning, a sentence flashed through his
brain.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Antony sat up, clenching his hands furiously
between his knees. It was absurd, preposterous.
There was no smallest occasion to take those
words in such a desperately literal sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, he will do all in his power to give the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
impression that he is simply and solely Michael
Field, working-man, and under-gardener at Chorley
Old Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words rang as clearly in his brain as if
there were someone in the room speaking them
aloud. Once more the window vanished. There
were no voices speaking now; there was only a
curious and rather horrible silence, in which there
was no need for voices.</p>
<p>The faintest little whine from Josephus aroused
him. It was long past the dinner hour, and racing
the sands is exceedingly hungry work.</p>
<p>Antony&#8217;s eyes came back from the window.
His face was rather white, and his mouth set in a
straight line. But there was an oddly triumphant
look in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a meal will do us both good, old man,&#8221;
he said with a little whimsical smile. And he
began getting down plates from the dresser.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>IN THE GARDEN</h3>
</div>

<p>Some fifteen or more years ago, the gardens
of Chorley Old Hall were famous for their beauty.
They still deserved to be famous, and the reason
that they were so no longer, arose merely from
the fact that they had become unknown, had sunk
into obscurity, since no one but the actual inmates
of the Hall, Doctor Hilary, and the gardeners
themselves ever set eyes on them.</p>
<p>Yet Golding, being an artist at heart, cared
for them for pure love of the work, rather than for
any kudos such care might bring him. Had he
read poetry with as great diligence as he read
works on horticulture, he would possibly have
declared his doctrine to be found in the words:&mdash;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>Certain it is that the gardens under his care
were as beautiful as gardens may be. Where
trimness was desirable, they were as neat, as well-ordered,
as stately as some old-world lady; where
nature was allowed fuller sway, they luxuriated
in a very riot of mad colour,&mdash;pagan, bacchanalian
almost, yet in completest harmony, despite the
freedom permitted.</p>
<p>Before the house, beyond a rose-embowered
terrace, a wide lawn, soft as thickest velvet, terminated
in two great yews, set far apart, a sundial
between them, and backgrounded by the sea
and sky. To right and left were flower borders
brilliant in colour, against yew hedges. Still
farther to the right was the Tangle Garden, where
climbing roses, honeysuckle, and clematis roamed
over pergolas and old tree stumps at their own
sweet will and fancy. Beyond the yew hedge
on the left was another garden of yews, and firs,
and hollies. A long avenue ran its full length
while white marble statues, set on either side,
gleamed among the darkness of the trees. The
end of the avenue formed a frame for an expanse of
billowing moorland, range upon range of hills,
melting from purple into pale lavender against
the distant sky.</p>
<p>Behind the house was another and smaller lawn,
broken in the middle by a great marble basin
filled with crystal water, whereon rested the smooth
flat leaves of water-lilies, and, in their time, the
big white blossoms of the chalice-like flowers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
themselves. A little fountain sprang from the
marble basin, making melodious music as the
ascending silver stream fell back once more towards
its source. Fantailed pigeons preened themselves
on the edge of the basin, and peacocks strutted
the velvet grass, spreading gorgeous tails of
waking eyes to the sun. Beyond the lawn, and
separated from it by an old box hedge, was an
orchard, where, in the early spring, masses of
daffodils danced among the rough grass, and where,
later, the trees were covered with a sheet of snowy
blossoms&mdash;pear, cherry, plum, and apple. A mellow
brick wall enclosed the orchard, a wall beautified
by small green ferns, by pink and red valerian,
and yellow toadflax. Behind the wall lay the
kitchen gardens and glass houses, which ended in
another wall separating them from a wood crowning
the heights on which Chorley Old Hall was
situated.</p>
<p>Had Antony had a free choice of English gardens
in which to work, it is quite conceivable that he
had chosen these very ones in which fate, or
Nicholas Danver&#8217;s conditions, had placed him.
In an astonishingly short space of time he was
taking as great a pride in them as Golding himself.
It is not to be supposed, however, that, at the outset,
Golding was over-pleased to welcome a young
man, who had been thrust upon him from the
unknown without so much as a by your leave
to him. For the first week or so, he eyed the cheerfully
self-contained young gardener with something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
very akin to suspicion, merely allotting to him the
heavy and commonplace tasks which Antony had
foreseen as his.</p>
<p>Antony made no attempt to impress Golding
with the fact that his knowledge of fruit growing,
if not of floriculture, was certainly on a level with
his own. It was mere chance that brought the
fact to light,&mdash;the question of a somewhat unusual
blight that had appeared on a fruit tree. Antony
happened to be in the vicinity of the peach tree
when Golding was remarking on it to another
gardener. Five minutes later, the second gardener
having departed, Antony approached Golding.
He respectfully mentioned the nature of the blight,
and suggested a remedy. It led to a conversation,
in which Golding&#8217;s eyes were very considerably
opened. He was not a man to continue to indulge
in prejudice merely because it had formerly existed
in his mind. He realized all at once that he had
found a kindred spirit in Antony, and a kind of
friendship between the two, having its basis on
horticulture, was the result. Not that he showed
him the smallest favouritism, however. That
would have been altogether outside his sense of the
fitness of things.</p>
<p>There were moments when Antony found the
situation extraordinarily amusing. Leaning on his
spade, he would look up from some freshly turned
patch of earth towards the old grey house, a light
of humorous laughter in his eyes. Virtually speaking
the place was his own already. The months
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
ahead, till he should enter into possession, were but
an accidental interlude, in a manner of speaking.
He was already planning a little drama in his own
mind. He saw himself sauntering into the garden
one fine morning, with Josephus at his heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, by the way, Golding,&#8221; he would say,
&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking we might have a bed of cosmos in
the southern corner of the Tangle Garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would do as well as any other remark for
a beginning, and he <i>would</i> like a bed of cosmos.
He could picture Golding&#8217;s stare of dignified
amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you giving orders?&#8221; he could imagine
his querying with dry sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; Antony heard himself
answering. &#8220;Though if you <i>have</i> any objection to
the cosmos&mdash;&#8221; And he would pause.</p>
<p>Golding would naturally think that he had
taken leave of his senses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the impression you&#8217;re master here,
perhaps?&#8221; Golding might say. Anyhow those
were the words Antony put into his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just happen to have that notion,&#8221; Antony
would reply pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when?&#8221; Golding ought to ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>notion</i>,&#8221; Antony would reply slowly,
&#8220;has been more or less in my mind since a year
ago last March. I am not sure whether the <i>fact</i>
dated from that month, or came into actuality this
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>There his imagination would fail him. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
would be an interim. Then the scene would
conclude by their having a drink together, Golding
looking at Antony over his glass to utter at slow
intervals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m jiggered.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so possible a little drama, so even probable
a little drama, it is small wonder that Antony
found himself chuckling quietly every now and
then as he considered it. The only thing was, that
he wanted it to hurry up, and that not solely for
his own sake, nor for the sake of his secret hopes,
nor for the sake of watching Golding&#8217;s amazed
face during the enactment of the little drama, but
quite largely for the sake of the big grey house,
which lay before him.</p>
<p>It looked so terribly lonely; it looked dead. It
was like a flower-surrounded corpse. That there
actually was life within it, he was aware, since
he had once seen a white-haired man at a window,
who, so a fellow-gardener had informed him on
being questioned later, must have been the old
butler. He and his wife had been left in charge as
caretakers. All the other indoor servants had been
dismissed by Doctor Hilary on his return from
that fateful journey from London. Somehow the
man&#8217;s presence at the window had seemed but
to emphasize the loneliness, the odd corpse-like
atmosphere of the house. It was as if a face had
looked out from a coffin. Antony never had
nearer view of either the butler or his wife. Tradespeople
called for orders, he believed; but, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
either the man or woman ever sought the fresh air,
it must be after the work in the gardens was over
for the day.</p>
<p>Antony liked to picture himself restoring life
to the old place. Now and again he allowed himself
to see a woman aiding him in the pleasant task.
He would picture her standing by the sundial, looking
out towards the sparkling water; standing by
the marble basin with white pigeons alighted at her
feet, and peacocks strutting near her; walking
among the marble statues, with a book; passing up
the wide steps of the solitary house, taking with
her the sunshine of the garden to cheer its gloom.</p>
<p>His heart still held hope as its guest. He had
put the thought of that possible emergency from
him on the same afternoon as he had decided on
his course of action, should it arise. He never
crossed bridges before he came to them, as the
saying is. He might recognize their possible
existence, he might recognize the possibility of
being called upon to cross them, even recognize
to the full all the unpleasantness he would find
on the other side. Having done so, he resolutely
refused to approach them till driven thereto by
fate.</p>
<p>He found a delight, too, in his little English
cottage, in his tiny orchard, and tinier garden.
Each evening saw him at work in it, first clearing
the place of weeds, reducing it to something like
order; later, putting in plants, and sowing seeds.
Each Sunday morning saw him walking the lonely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
beach with Josephus, and, when Mass was over,
seeking the little church where the Duchessa had
formerly worshipped, and would worship again.
Added to the quite extraordinary pleasure he felt
in sitting in her very chair, was strange sense of
peace in the little building. Father Dormer became
quite accustomed to seeing the solitary figure in the
church. Of course later, Antony knew, it might be
desirable that these visits should cease, but till the
end of June, at all events, he was safe.</p>
<p>On Saturday and Sunday afternoons and evenings
he took long walks inland, exploring moorland,
wood, and stream, and recalling many a
childish memory. He found the pond where he
had endangered his life at the instigation of the
fair-haired angel, whose name he could not yet
recall. The pond had not shrunk in size as is
usual with childhood&#8217;s recollections; on the contrary
it was quite a large pond, a deep pond, and he
found himself marvelling that he had ever had
the temerity to attempt to cross it on so insecure
a bark as a mere log of wood. Possibly the
angel had been particularly insistent, and, despite
the fact that he was a good many years her senior,
he had feared her scorn. He found the wood
where he and she had been caught kneeling by the
pheasant&#8217;s nests. It had been well for him that
the contents had not already been transferred to
his pockets. The crime had been in embryo, so
to speak, performed, by good chance, merely in
intention rather than in deed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>Now the wood was a mass of shimmering bluebells,
and alive with the notes of song birds.
Antony would lie at full length on the moss, listening
to the various notes, dreamily content as his
body luxuriated in temporary idleness. As the
afternoon passed into evening the sound of a church
bell would float up to him from the hidden village.
He had discovered by now another church, on the
outskirts of the village, an old stone edifice dating
from long before the times of the so-called reformation.
It never claimed him as a visitor, however:
it held no attraction for him as did the little
barn-like building on the quay. The sound of the
bell would rouse him to matters present, and he
would return to his cottage to prepare his evening
meal, after which he sat in the little parlour with
pipe and book.</p>
<p>Thus quietly the days passed by. May gave
place to June, with meadows waist high in perfumed
grass, and hedges fragrant with honeysuckle,
while Antony&#8217;s thoughts went more
frequently out to Woodleigh and the Duchessa&#8217;s
return.</p>
<p>He had seen the little place from the moorland,
looking down into it where it lay in a hollow among
the trees. He had seen the one big house it
boasted, white-walled and thatch-roofed, half-hidden
by climbing roses. Before many days were
passed the Duchessa would be once more within it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A MEETING</h3>
</div>

<p>And as the end of June drew nearer, Antony
found himself once more contemplating a possible
meeting with the Duchessa, contemplating, also,
the worst that meeting might hold in store.</p>
<p>An odd, indefinable restlessness was upon him.
He told himself quite plainly that, in all probability
before many weeks, many days even, were passed,
there would be a severance of that friendship
which meant so much to him. He forced himself
to realize it, to dwell upon it, to bring consciously
home to his soul the blankness the severance would
bring with it. There was a certain relief in facing
the worst; yet he could not always face it. There
was the trouble. Now and then a hope, which he
told himself was futile, would spring unbidden to
his heart, establish itself as a radiant guest. Yet
presently it would depart, mocking him; or fade
into nothingness leaving a blank greyness in its
stead.</p>
<p>Uncertainty&mdash;though reason told him none
was existent&mdash;tantalized, tormented him. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
then, when certainty came nearest home to him,
he knew he had still to learn the final and definite
manner of its coming. That it must inevitably be
preceded by moments of soul torture he was aware.
Yet what precise form would that soul torture
take?</p>
<p>He put the query aside. He dared not face
it. Once, lying wide-eyed in the darkness, gazing
through the small square of his window at the star-powdered
sky without, an odd smile had twisted
his lips. Pain, bodily pain, had at one time been
his close companion for weeks, he had then fancied
he had known once and for all the worst of her
torments. He knew now that her dealings with
the body are quite extraordinarily light in comparison
to her dealings with the mind. And this was
only anticipation.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>One Saturday afternoon he started off for a
walk on a hitherto untried route. It was in a
direction entirely opposite to Woodleigh, which he
now wished to avoid.</p>
<p>Half an hour&#8217;s walking brought him to a wide
expanse of moorland, as lonely a spot as can well be
imagined. Behind him lay Byestry and the sea; to
his left, also, lay the sea, since the coast took a deep
turn northwards about three miles or so to the
west of Byestry; to the right, and far distant, lay
Woodleigh. Before him was the moorland, covered
with heather and gorse bushes. About half a
mile distant it descended in a gentle decline, possibly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
to some hidden village below, since a broadish
grass path, or species of roadway bearing wheel
tracts, showed that, despite its present loneliness,
it was at times traversed by human beings.</p>
<p>Antony sat down by a gorse bush, whose golden
flowers were scenting the air with a sweet aromatic
scent. Mingling with their scent was the scent
of thyme and heather, and the hot scent of the
sunbaked earth. Bees boomed lazily in the still
air, and far off was the faint melodious note of the
ever-moving sea. The sun was hot and the
droning of the bees drowsy in its insistence.
After a few moments Antony stretched himself
comfortably on the heather, and slept.</p>
<p>A slight sound roused him, and he sat up, for
the first moment barely realizing his whereabouts.
Then he saw the source of the sound which had
awakened him. Coming along the grass path, and
not fifty paces from him, was a small pony and
trap, driven by a woman. Antony looked towards
it, and, as he looked, he felt his heart jump,
leap, and set off pounding at a terrible rate.</p>
<p>In two minutes the trap was abreast him, and
the little Dartmoor pony was brought to a sudden
standstill. Antony had got to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gray,&#8221; exclaimed an astonished voice,
though very assuredly there was a note of keen
delight mingled with the astonishment.</p>
<p>Antony pulled off his cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy meeting you here!&#8221; cried the Duchessa
di Donatello. &#8220;Why ever didn&#8217;t you let me know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
that you were in these parts? Or, perhaps you
have only just arrived, and were going to come and
see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the fraction of a pause. Then,</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been at Byestry since the beginning of
May,&#8221; said Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Byestry,&#8221; exclaimed the Duchessa. &#8220;But
why ever didn&#8217;t you tell me when you wrote,
instead of saying it was impossible to come and
see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know then that Woodleigh and
Byestry lay so near together,&#8221; said Antony. And
then he stopped. What on earth was he to say
next?</p>
<p>The Duchessa looked at him. There was an
oddness in his manner she could not understand.
He seemed entirely different from the man she
had known on the <i>Fort Salisbury</i>. Yet&mdash;well,
perhaps it was only fancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know now, anyhow,&#8221; she responded
gaily. &#8220;And you must come and see me.&#8221; Then
her glance fell upon his clothes. Involuntarily a
little puzzlement crept into her eyes, a little amazed
query.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing at Byestry?&#8221; she asked.
The question had come. Antony&#8217;s hand clenched
on the side of the pony-trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m one of the under-gardeners at Chorley
Old Hall,&#8221; he responded cheerfully, and as if it
were the most entirely natural thing in the world,
though his heart was as heavy as lead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; queried the Duchessa
bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that,&#8221; said Antony, still cheerfully,
&#8220;under-gardener at Chorley Old Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; demanded the Duchessa, the
tiniest frown between her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is my work,&#8221; said Antony briefly.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t quite understand,&#8221; said the
Duchessa slowly. &#8220;You&mdash;you aren&#8217;t a labourer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;That happens to be exactly what I am,&#8221; he
responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Mr. Gray?&#8221; There was
bewilderment in the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly what I have said,&#8221; returned Antony
almost stubbornly. &#8220;I am under-gardener at
Chorley Old Hall, or, in other words, a labourer.
I get a pound a week wage, and a furnished cottage,
for which I pay five shillings a week rent. My
name, by the way, is Michael Field.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa looked straight at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then on the ship you pretended to be someone
you were not?&#8221; she asked slowly.</p>
<p>Antony shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the reason you wrote and said you
couldn&#8217;t see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Antony shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>The Duchessa&#8217;s face was white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you pretend to be other than you
were?&#8221; she demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>Antony was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;that, for all
your talk of friendship, you did not trust me
sufficiently. You did not trust my friendship
had I known, and therefore you deliberately
deceived me all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Antony was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really meant to deceive me?&#8221; There was
an odd note of appeal in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you like to call it that,&#8221; replied Antony
steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;What else can I call it?&#8221; she flashed.</p>
<p>There was a long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be grateful if you would not mention
having known me as Antony Gray,&#8221; said Antony
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do not intend to refer to that
unfortunate episode again,&#8221; she replied icily. &#8220;As
far as I am concerned it will be blotted from my
memory as completely as I can wipe out so disagreeable
an incident. Will you, please, take your
hand off my trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony withdrew his hand as if the trap had
stung him.</p>
<p>The Duchessa touched the pony with her whip,
Antony stood looking after them. When, once
more, the moorland was deserted, he sat down
again on the heather.</p>
<p>Josephus, returning from a rabbit hunt more
than an hour later, found him still there in the
same position. Disturbed by something queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
in his deity&#8217;s mood, he thrust a wet black nose
into his hand.</p>
<p>The touch roused Antony. He looked up, half
dazed. Then he saw Josephus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done it now, old man,&#8221; he said. And
there was a queer little catch in his voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>AT THE MANOR HOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p>The Duchessa di Donatello was sitting at
dinner. Silver and roses gleamed on the white
damask of the table-cloth. The French windows
stood wide open, letting in the soft air of the
warm June evening. Through the windows she
could see the lawn surrounded by elms, limes, and
walnut trees. The sun was slanting low behind
them, throwing long blue shadows on the grass.
A thrush sang in one of the elm trees, a brown
songster carolling his vespers from a topmost
branch.</p>
<p>At the other end of the table sat a kindly-faced
middle-aged woman, in a grey dress and a lace
fichu fastened with a large cameo brooch. She
was Miss Esther Tibbutt, the Duchessa&#8217;s present
companion, and one-time governess. Now
and then she looked across the table towards
the Duchessa, with a little hint of anxiety in her
eyes, but her conversation was as brisk and
unflagging as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you had a nice drive this afternoon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
my dear. And did Clinker go well?&#8221; Clinker
was the Dartmoor pony.</p>
<p>The Duchessa roused herself. She was evidently
preoccupied about something, thought Miss
Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, very well. And he has quite got
over objecting to the little stream by Crossways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he would in time. So you went
right over the Crossways. Which way did you
come home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over Stagmoor,&#8221; said the Duchessa briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stagmoor,&#8221; echoed Miss Tibbutt. &#8220;My dear,
that <i>is</i> such a lonely road. I should have been
quite anxious had I known. Supposing you had
an accident it might be hours before any one found
you. I suppose you didn&#8217;t see a soul?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just one man,&#8221; returned the Duchessa
carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A labourer I suppose,&#8221; queried Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, only a labourer,&#8221; responded the Duchessa
quietly.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt was silent. She had a vague
feeling of uneasiness, and yet she did not know why
she had it. She was perfectly certain that something
was wrong; and, whatever that something
was, it had occurred between the time Pia had set
off in the pony-cart with Clinker after lunch, and
her return, very late for tea, in the evening. Also,
Pia had said she didn&#8217;t want any tea, but had gone
straight to her room. And that was unlike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
her,&mdash;certainly unlike her. It would have been far more
natural for her to have ordered a fresh supply, and
insisted on Miss Tibbutt sharing it with her, quite
oblivious of the fact that she had already had all
the tea she wanted, and was going to eat again at a
quarter to eight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I walked over to Byestry,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt
presently. &#8220;Yes, I know it was very hot, but I
walked slowly, and took my largest sunshade. I
wanted to get some black silk to mend one of my
dresses. I saw Father Dormer. He was very glad
to hear that you were back. I told him you had
only arrived on Thursday, and I had come on the
Tuesday to get things ready for you. My dear, he
told me Mr. Danver is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Danver,&#8221; exclaimed the Duchessa, her
preoccupation for the moment forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I wonder none of the servants happened
to mention it. But I suppose they forgot we didn&#8217;t
know, and probably they have forgotten all about
the poor man by now. It&#8217;s sad to think how soon
one <i>is</i> forgotten. It appears he went to London
in March with Doctor Hilary to consult a specialist
and died the day after his arrival in town. Perhaps
the journey was too much for him. I should
think it might have been, but Doctor Hilary would
know best, or perhaps Mr. Danver insisted on
going. Anyhow the place is in the hands of caretakers
now; the butler and his wife are looking
after it till the heir turns up, whoever he may be.
There&#8217;s a rumour that he is an American, but no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
one seems to know for certain. But they must be
keeping the garden in good order. Golding is
staying on, and the other men, and they&#8217;ve just
got another under-gardener.&#8221; She paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they?&#8221; said the Duchessa carelessly, and
a trifle coldly. Nevertheless a little colour had
flushed into her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you think I&#8217;m a terrible gossip,&#8221;
said Miss Tibbutt apologetically. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t
mean to be. But in a little place, little things
interest one. I am afraid I did ask Father Dormer
a good many questions. I hope he didn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;
And she broke off anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear old Tibby,&#8221; smiled the Duchessa,
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t. Nobody thinks you&#8217;re a
gossip. Gossiping is talking about things people
don&#8217;t want known, and generally things that are
rather unkind, to say the least of it. You&#8217;re the
soul of honour and charity, and Father Dormer
knows that as well as everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear!&#8221; expostulated Miss Tibbutt.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m glad you think he didn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa got up from the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he didn&#8217;t. Let us go into the
garden, and have coffee out there. The fresh air
will blow away the cobwebs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt followed the Duchessa through
the French window and across the wide gravel
path, on to the lawn. The Duchessa led the way
to a seat beneath the lime trees. The bees were
droning among the hanging flowers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any cobwebs in your mind, my
dear?&#8221; asked Miss Tibbutt as they sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221; queried the Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear! I don&#8217;t know. You said
that about cobwebs, you see. And I thought
you seemed&mdash;well, just a little preoccupied at
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to tell,&#8221; said the Duchessa
lightly. &#8220;A rather pretty soap-bubble burst and
turned into an unpleasant cobweb, that&#8217;s all.
So&mdash;well, I&#8217;ve just been brushing my mind clear
of both the cobweb and the memory of the soap-bubble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certain it&mdash;the cobweb&mdash;isn&#8217;t worrying
you now?&#8221; asked Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Tibby, it has ceased to exist,&#8221;
laughed the Duchessa.</p>
<p>It was a very reassuring little laugh. Miss
Tibbutt knew it to be quite absurd that, in spite
of it, she still could not entirely dispel that vague
sense of uneasiness. It spoilt the keen pleasure
she ordinarily took in the garden, especially in the
evening and most particularly in the month of
June. She had a real sentiment about the month
of June. From the first day to the last she held
the hours tenderly, lingeringly, loath to let them slip
between her fingers. There were only three more
days left, and now there was this tiny uneasiness,
which prevented her mind from entirely concentrating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
on the happiness of these remaining
hours.</p>
<p>And then she gave herself a little mental shake.
It was, after all, a selfish consideration on her
part. If there were cause for uneasiness, she
ought to be thinking of Pia rather than herself,
and if there were no cause&mdash;and Pia had just declared
there was not&mdash;she was being thoroughly
absurd. She gave herself a second mental shake,
and looked towards the house, whence a young
footman was just emerging with a tray on which
were two coffee cups and a sugar basin. He put
the tray down on a small rustic table near them,
and went back the way he had come, his step
making no sound on the soft grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what it feels like to be a servant,
and have to do everything to time,&#8221; she said
suddenly. &#8220;It must be trying to have to be
invariably punctual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as a matter of fact, Miss Tibbutt was
exceedingly punctual, but then it was by no means
absolutely incumbent upon her to be so; she could
quite well have absented herself entirely from a
meal if she desired. That, of course, made all the
difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are punctual,&#8221; said the Duchessa laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. But it wouldn&#8217;t in the least matter
if I were not. You could go on without me. You
couldn&#8217;t very well go on if Dale had forgotten to
lay the table, or if Morris had felt disinclined to
cook the food.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed the Duchessa. And then, after
a moment, she said, &#8220;Anyhow there are some
things we have to do to time&mdash;Mass on Sundays
and days of obligation, for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt nodded. &#8220;Oh, of course. But
that&#8217;s generally only once a week. Besides that&#8217;s
different. It&#8217;s a big voice that tells one to do
that&mdash;the voice of the Church. The other is a
little human voice giving the orders. I know, in a
sense, one ought to hear the big voice behind it all;
but sometimes one would forget to listen for it.
At least, I know I should. And then I should
simply hate the routine, and doing things&mdash;little
ordinary everyday things&mdash;to time. I&#8217;d just
love to say, if I were cook, that there shouldn&#8217;t
be any meals to-day, or that they should be
an hour later, or an hour earlier, to suit my
fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Tibby, it&#8217;s quite obvious that your
vocation is not to the religious life. Fancy you in
a convent! I can imagine you suggesting to the
Reverend Mother that a change in the time of
saying divine office would be desirable, or at all
events that it should be varied on alternate days;
and I can see you going off for long and rampageous
days in the country, just for a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she said gravely. &#8220;I should hear
the big voice there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d hear it speak through quite a number
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of human voices, anyhow,&#8221; returned the
Duchessa.</p>
<p>There was a silence. She wondered what odd
coincidence had led Tibby to such a subject.
If it were not a coincidence, it must be a kind of
thought transference. Almost unconsciously she
had been seeing a tall, thin, brown-faced man
marching off in the early morning hours to his
work in a garden. She had seen him busy with
hoe and spade, till the bell over the stables at the
Hall announced the dinner hour. She had seen
him again take up his implements at the summons
of the same bell, working through the sunshine
or the rain, as the case might be, till its final evening
dismissal. Above all, she had seen him taking
his orders from Golding, a well-meaning man
truly, and an exceedingly capable gardener, but&mdash;well,
she pictured Antony as she had seen him in
evening dress on the <i>Fort Salisbury</i>, as she had seen
him throwing coppers to the brown-faced girl
outside the Cathedral at Teneriffe, as she had
seen him sitting in the little courtyard with the
orange trees in green tubs, and the idea of his
receiving and taking orders from Golding seemed
to her quite extraordinarily incongruous.</p>
<p>Yet until Miss Tibbutt had introduced the
subject, she had been more or less unaware of
these mental pictures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; she remarked suddenly, and quite
obviously in continuation of her last remark, &#8220;it
entirely depends on what you have been brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
up to, I mean, of course as regards the question of
being a servant. The question of a religious is
entirely different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, entirely,&#8221; agreed Miss Tibbutt promptly.
&#8220;You can always get another place as a servant if
you happen to dislike the one you are in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Duchessa, slowly and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>A sudden little anxious pang had all at once
stabbed her somewhere near the region of the
heart. Would that be the effect of that afternoon&#8217;s
meeting? Most assuredly she hoped it
would not be, and equally assuredly she had no
idea she was hoping it; verily, her feeling towards
Antony was one of mingled anger, indignation, and
mortified pride.</p>
<p>Once more there was a silence,&mdash;a silence in
which Miss Tibbutt sat stirring her coffee, and
looking towards the reflection of the sunset sky
seen through the branches of the trees opposite.
Suddenly she spoke, dismayed apology in her
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, I&#8217;m so sorry, I quite forgot.
A letter came for you this afternoon. I put it
down on the little round table in the drawing-room
window, meaning to give it to you when you
came in. But you went straight to your room,
and so I forgot it. I will get it at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said the Duchessa lightly, &#8220;I
will get it. I don&#8217;t suppose for an instant that it
is important.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>She got up and went across the lawn. In a
minute or two she returned, an open letter in her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Trix,&#8221; she announced as she sat
down again, &#8220;She wants to know if she can
come down here at the beginning of August.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt literally beamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How delightful!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Trix has
never stayed with you here. You will like having
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Trix,&#8221; said the Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do so enjoy Trix,&#8221; remarked Miss Tibbutt
fervently.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do most people,&#8221; smiled the Duchessa.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A DREAM AND OTHER THINGS</h3>
</div>

<p>It is perfectly amazing to what a degree the
physical conditions of the atmosphere appear to
be bound up with one&#8217;s own mental atmosphere.
In the more ordinary nature of things, the physical
conditions will act on the mental, sending your
mind up to the point marked gaiety when the sun
shines, dropping it down to despair&mdash;or, at any
rate, down to dulness&mdash;when the skies are leaden.
Also, in more extreme cases, the mental conditions
will act on the physical, if not actually, at least
with so good a show of reality as to appear genuine.
If you are thoroughly unhappy&mdash;no mere, light,
passing depression, mind you&mdash;it matters not at
all how brilliant the sunshine may be, it is nothing
but grey fog for all you see of it. If, on the other
hand, you are in the seventh heaven of joy, the
grey clouds are suffused with a golden light of
radiance. But these are extreme cases.</p>
<p>It was an extreme case with Antony. Despite
the sunshine which lay upon the earth, despite the
singing of the birds in the early morning, and at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
evening, despite the flowers which displayed their
colours and lavished their scents around him as he
worked, the world might have been bathed in fog
for all he saw of its brightness. Hope had taken
unto herself wings and fled from him, and with her
joy had departed.</p>
<p>He felt a queer bitterness towards his work,
a bitterness towards the garden and the big grey
house, and most particularly towards the man who
had lived in it, and who was responsible for his
present unhappiness. He had none towards the
Duchessa. But then, after all, he appeared in her
eyes as a fraud, the thing of all others he himself
most detested. He could not possibly blame her
for her attitude in the matter. Yet all the time, he
had a queer feeling of something like remorse for
his present bitterness; it was almost as if the
garden and the very flowers themselves were reproaching
him for it, reminding him that they
were not to blame. And then a little incident
suddenly served to dispel his gloom, at all events in
a great measure.</p>
<p>It was a slight incident, a trivial incident,
merely an odd dream. Nevertheless, having in
view its oddness, and&mdash;unlike most dreams&mdash;its
curious connectedness, also its effect on Antony&#8217;s
spirit, it may be well to record it.</p>
<p>He dreamt he was walking in a garden. He
knew it was the garden of Chorley Old Hall,
though there was something curiously unlike about
it, as there often is in dreams. The garden was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
full of flowers, and he could smell their strong,
sweet scent. At one side of the garden&mdash;and
this, in spite of that curious unlikeness, was the
only distinctly unlike thing about it&mdash;was a gate
of twisted iron. He was standing a long way
from the gate, and he was conscious of two distinct
moods within himself,&mdash;an impulse which urged
him towards the gate, and something which held
him back from approaching it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from another direction, he saw a
woman coming towards him. Recognition and
amazement fell upon him. She was the same
small girl he had played with in his boyhood, and
whose name he could not remember, but grown to
womanhood. She came towards him, her fair
hair uncovered, and shining in the sunshine.</p>
<p>As she reached him she stood still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony,&#8221; she cried in her old imperious way,
&#8220;why don&#8217;t you go to the gate at once? She is
waiting to be let in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is waiting?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and see,&#8221; she retorted. And she went off
among the flowers, turning once to laugh back at
him over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Antony stood looking after her, till she disappeared
in the distance. Then he went slowly
towards the gate. As he came near it, he saw a
figure standing outside. But he could not see it
distinctly, because, curiously enough, though the
garden was full of sunshine, it was dark outside the
gate, as if it were night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked Antony.</p>
<p>The figure made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Still the figure made no reply.</p>
<p>Antony felt his heart beating quickly, madly.
And then, suddenly from a distance behind him, he
heard a gay mocking voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you open the gate, silly? Can&#8217;t
you hear her knocking?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Antony stood irresolute, though he heard
little taps falling on the iron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open it, open it,&#8221; came the sweet mocking
voice, this time with a suspicion of pleading
in it.</p>
<p>Antony went towards the gate. A great key
was sticking in the iron lock. He took hold of
it and found it needed the strength of both his
hands to turn. Then he flung the gate wide open.
The figure moved slowly through the gate, and
into the full sunshine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antony,&#8221; she said smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You! You at last!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>And he woke, to find he had cried the words
aloud. He sat up in bed. A white pigeon was on
the sill outside his window, tapping with its beak
on the glass.</p>
<p>Of course it was an entirely trifling incident,
and probably he was superstitious to attach any
real importance to it. Nevertheless it had a very
marked influence on his spirits.</p>
<p>Doubtless it was as well it had, since about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
this time a certain happening occurred, which,
though it did not precisely depress him, most
assuredly caused him considerable anger and
indignation.</p>
<p>In spite of the somewhat hermit-like life he
led, he nevertheless had something of an acquaintance
with his fellow-creatures. Among these
fellow-creatures there was one, Job Grantley, a
labourer on the home farm, possessed of a pretty,
rather fragile wife, and a baby of about three
months old. Antony had a kindly feeling for the
fellow, and often they exchanged the time of day
when meeting on the road, or when Job chanced to
pass Antony&#8217;s garden in the evening.</p>
<p>One evening Antony, busy weeding his small
flagged path, saw Job in the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; said Antony; and then he
perceived by the other&#8217;s face, that matters were
not as they might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, what&#8217;s amiss with the world at all?&#8221;
demanded Antony, going down towards the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that fellow Curtis,&#8221; said Job briefly,
leaning on the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;ll he have been up to now?&#8221; asked
Antony. It would not be the first time he had
heard tales of the agent.</p>
<p>Job kicked the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Says he&#8217;s wanting my cottage for a chauffeur
he&#8217;s getting down from Bristol, and I&#8217;m to turn out
at the end of August.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Devil take the man!&#8221; cried Antony. &#8220;Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
can&#8217;t his new chauffeur be living in the room above
the garage, like the old one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Job grunted. &#8220;Because this one&#8217;s a married
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where are you to go at all?&#8221; demanded a
wrathful Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says I can have the cottage over to Crossways,&#8221;
said Job. &#8220;He knows &#8217;tis three mile
farther from my work. But that&#8217;s not all. &#8217;Tis
double the rent, and I can&#8217;t afford it. And that&#8217;s
the long and short of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony dug his hoe savagely into the earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t he be putting his own chauffeur
there, and be paying him wage enough for the
higher rent?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Job bitterly. &#8220;Because
he won&#8217;t. He&#8217;s had his knife into me ever since
March last, when I paid up my rent which he
thought I couldn&#8217;t do. I&#8217;d been asking him for
time; then the last day&mdash;well, I got the money. I
wasn&#8217;t going to tell him how I got it, and he thought
I&#8217;d been crying off with no reason. See? Now he
thinks he can force me to the higher rent. &#8217;Tis
a bigger cottage, but &#8217;tis so far off, even well-to-do
folk fight shy of the extra walk, and so it&#8217;s stood
empty a year and more. Now he&#8217;s thinking he&#8217;ll
force my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you do?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord knows,&#8221; returned Job gloomily.
&#8220;If I chuck up my work here, how do I know I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
get a job elsewhere? If I go to the other place
I&#8217;ll be behind with my rent for dead certain, and
get kicked out of that, and be at the loss of ten
shillings or so for the move. I&#8217;ve not told the wife
yet. But I can see nought for it but to look out
for a job elsewhere. Wish I&#8217;d never set foot in
this blasted little Devonshire village. Wish I&#8217;d
stayed in my own parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony was making a mental survey of affairs,
a survey at once detailed yet rapid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;d give a pretty good
deal to get even with that old skinflint, I would
that. You and your wife just shift up along
with me. There&#8217;s an extra room upstairs with nothing
in it at all. We&#8217;ll manage top hole. Sure,
&#8217;twill be fine havin&#8217; me cooking done for me. You
can be giving me the matter of a shilling a week,
and let the cooking go for the rest of the rent.
What&#8217;ll you be thinking at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the offer was prompted by sheer impulsive
kind-heartedness, wedded to a keen indignation
at injustice. Yet it must be confessed
that a sensation exceeding akin to dismay followed
close on its heels. Of his own free will he was
flinging his privacy from him, and hugging intrusion
to his heart.</p>
<p>Job shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not stand it,&#8221; said he briefly. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t say anything, but we know right enough
you&#8217;re a come down. You didn&#8217;t start in the same
mould as the rest of us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rubbish,&#8221; retorted Antony on a note of half-anger
and wholly aghast at the other&#8217;s perspicacity.
&#8220;I&#8217;m the same clay as yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A duke&#8217;s that,&#8221; declared Job, &#8220;but the mould&#8217;s
different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saints alive!&#8221; cried Antony, &#8220;it&#8217;s no matter
what the mould may be. Sure, it&#8217;s just a question
of what it&#8217;s been used for at all. My mould has
been used for labour since I was little more than a
boy, and stiffer labour than this little smiling
village has dreamt of, that&#8217;s sure. Besides, think
of your wife and child, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Job hesitated, debated within his soul. &#8220;It&#8217;s
them I am thinking of,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I could fend for
myself well enough, and snap my fingers at Curtis
and his like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, &#8217;tis settled,&#8221; said Antony with amazing
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>There was a silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Job at last, &#8220;if you&#8217;re in the
same mind a week hence, but don&#8217;t you go for
doing things in a hurry-like, that you&#8217;ll repent
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis settled now,&#8221; said Antony. &#8220;Tell your
wife, and snap your fingers at that old curmudgeon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless despite his cheery assurance, he
had a very bitter qualm at his heart as, an hour
or so later, he looked round his little cottage, and
realized, even more forcibly, precisely what he had
done.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he told himself and Josephus
with a good show of bravery, &#8220;it&#8217;s not for a lifetime.
And, hang it all, a man&#8217;s mere comfort
ought to give way before injustice of that kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus he buoyed himself up.</p>
<p>And then another aspect of affairs arose.</p>
<p>No one knew how the matter of the intended
arrangement leaked out. Job vowed he&#8217;d mentioned
it to no one but his wife; his wife vowed
she mentioned it to no one but Job. Perhaps
they spoke too near an open window. Be that as
it may, Antony, again at work in his garden one
evening, became aware of Mr. Curtis looking at
him over the little hedge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; said Mr. Curtis smoothly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; returned Antony equally
smoothly, and going on with his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you&#8217;re thinking of taking in lodgers,&#8221;
said Mr. Curtis blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure now, that&#8217;s interesting hearing,&#8221; returned
Antony pleasantly, and wondering who on earth
had babbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Mr. Curtis, still blandly, &#8220;I
was misinformed. I heard the Grantleys were
moving up here. I daresay it was merely an idle
rumour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it may have been,&#8221; returned Antony nonchalantly,
and sticking his spade into the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been,&#8221; said Mr. Curtis thoughtfully.
&#8220;All lodging houses are rented at ten
shillings a week, even unfurnished small ones, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
five shillings. Besides Grantley is only getting a
pound a week wage. He can&#8217;t afford to live in
apartments, unless he&#8217;s come in for a fortune.
If he has I must look out for another man. Men
with fortunes get a trifle above themselves, you
know. Besides he&#8217;d naturally not wish to stay on.
But of course the whole thing&#8217;s merely a rumour.
I&#8217;d contradict it if I were you. Good evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked up the lane smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bounder,&#8221; said Antony softly, looking
after him. &#8220;Just you wait till next March, my
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left his spade stuck into the earth, and
went back into the cottage. Half an hour later,
he was walking quickly in the direction of Byestry.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Doctor Hilary was in his surgery, when he was
told that Michael Field had asked if he could see
him. He went at once to the little waiting-room.
Antony rose at his entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, sor,&#8221; he said, touching his forehead.
&#8220;Can you be sparing me five minutes&#8217;
talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said Doctor Hilary. &#8220;Sit
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony sat down. In a few brief words he put
the Grantley affair before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Doctor Hilary, as he finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; queried Antony, &#8220;can nothing be
done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary shook his head. &#8220;I am not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
agent. I have no voice in the management of the
estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can do nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Antony, &#8220;that&#8217;s all I wanted
to know.&#8221; He got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down again,&#8221; said Doctor Hilary.</p>
<p>Antony sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean to do?&#8221; asked Doctor
Hilary quietly.</p>
<p>Antony looked directly at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I can do. I&#8217;ll get that extra
rent to Job somehow. He mustn&#8217;t know it comes
from me; I must think out how to manage. But,
of course, that&#8217;s merely a make-shift in the business.
I wanted the injustice put straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary looked through the window
behind Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me advise you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to do nothing
of the kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; The words came short and rather
quick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Mr. Curtis means to get rid of Grantley.
He has got his knife into him, as Grantley
said. Your action would merely postpone the
evil day, and make it worse in the postponement.
Job Grantley had better go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how about another job?&#8221; demanded
Antony.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;He
must see what he can find.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well of all the&mdash;&#8221; began Antony. And then
he stopped. After all, he&#8217;d seen enough injustice
in his time, to be used to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re honest in saying I would make it worse
for Job if I tried to help him?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly honest,&#8221; said Doctor Hilary with an
odd little smile.</p>
<p>Antony again got up from his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; and his voice was constrained.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be keeping you any longer, sor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary went with him to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about this business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; said Antony indifferently.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary went back to his surgery.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t believe me,&#8221; he said to himself,
&#8220;small wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled out his note-book and made a note in
it. Then he shut the book and put it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s the kind of thing we
wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memorandum he had entered, ran:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Write Sinclair <i>re</i> Grantley.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>TRIX ON THE SCENE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Tibby, angel, what&#8217;s the matter with Pia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix Devereux was sitting on the little rustic
table beneath the lime trees, smoking a cigarette.
Miss Tibbutt was sitting on the rustic seat,
knitting some fine lace. The ball of knitting
cotton was in a black satin bag on her lap.</p>
<p>Trix had arrived at Woodleigh the previous day,
two days earlier than she had been expected. A
telegram had preceded her appearance. It was
a lengthy telegram, an explicit telegram. It set
forth various facts in a manner entirely characteristic
of Trix. Firstly, it announced her almost
immediate arrival; secondly, it remarked on the
extraordinary heat in London; and thirdly it
stated quite clearly her own overwhelming and
instant desire for the nice, fresh, cool, clean,
country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trix is coming to-day,&#8221; the Duchessa had
said as she read it.</p>
<p>&#8220;How delightful!&#8221; Miss Tibbutt had replied
instantly. And then, after a moment&#8217;s pause,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
&#8220;There will be plenty of food because Father
Dormer is dining here to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa had laughed. It was so entirely
like Tibby to think of food the first thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she had replied. And then reflectively,
&#8220;I think it might be desirable to telephone
to Doctor Hilary and ask him to come too. It
really is not fair to ask Father Dormer to meet
three solitary females.&#8221;</p>
<p>A second time Miss Tibbutt had momentarily
and mentally surveyed the contents of the larder,
and almost immediately had nodded her entire
approval of the idea. She most thoroughly enjoyed
the mild excitement of a little dinner party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tibby, angel, what&#8217;s the matter with Pia?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question fell rather like a bomb, though
quite a small bomb, into the sunshine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter with Pia,&#8221; echoed Miss Tibbutt.
&#8220;What do you think, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Trix wisely, &#8220;is precisely what
I am asking you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt laid down her knitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;But do you think anything <i>is</i> the matter?&#8221;
she questioned anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think, I know,&#8221; remarked Trix succinctly.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt took off her spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she is so bright,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Trix nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. She&#8217;s too bright. Oh, one
can overdo the merry light-hearted rôle, I assure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
you. And then, to a new-comer at all events, the
cloak becomes apparent. But haven&#8217;t you the
smallest idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the least,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;I fancied
one evening shortly after she returned here, that
something was a little wrong. I remember I asked
her. She talked about soap-bubbles and cobwebs
but said there weren&#8217;t any left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of which,&#8221; smiled Trix. &#8220;Soap-bubbles or
cobwebs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cobwebs,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt earnestly.
&#8220;Or was it both? She said,&mdash;yes, I remember now
just what she did say&mdash;she said that a pretty
bubble had burst and become a cobweb. And
when I asked her if the cobweb were bothering
her, she said both it and the bubble had vanished.
So, you see!&#8221; This last on a note of
triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; said Trix ruminative, dubious. &#8220;Bubbles
have a way of taking up more space than
one would imagine, and their bursting sometimes
leaves an unpleasant gap. The bursting of this
one has left a gap in Pia&#8217;s life. You haven&#8217;t,
by any chance, the remotest notion of its colour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Its colour?&#8221; queried Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>Trix laughed. &#8220;Nonsense, Tibby, angel, nonsense
pure and simple. But all the same, I wish
I knew for dead certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt anxiously, though
she hadn&#8217;t the smallest notion what advantage a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
knowledge of the colour would be to either one of
them.</p>
<p>Trix dabbed the stump of her cigarette on the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t let her know we think there&#8217;s anything
wrong. If you want to remain wrapped up
in the light-hearted cloak, nothing is more annoying
than having any one prying to see what&#8217;s
underneath,&mdash;unless it&#8217;s the right person, of course.
And we&#8217;re not sure that we are&mdash;yet. We must
just wait till she feels like giving us a peep, if she
ever does.&#8221;</p>
<p>A silence fell. Miss Tibbutt took up her
knitting again. Trix hummed a little air from a
popular opera. Presently Miss Tibbutt sighed.
Trix left off humming.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Tibby?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt sighed more deeply. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
it&#8217;s my fault,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your fault?&#8221; demanded Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve not noticed Pia. I thought everything
was all right after what she said. I ought to
have noticed. I&#8217;ve been too wrapped up in my
own affairs. Perhaps if I&#8217;d been more sympathetic
I should have found out what was the
matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix laughed, a happy amused, comfortable
little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tibby, you angel, that&#8217;s so like you. You
always want to shoulder the blame for every speck
of wrong-doing or depression that appears in your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
little universe. Women like you always do. It&#8217;s
an odd sort of responsible unselfishness. That
doesn&#8217;t in the very least express to any one else
what I mean, but it does to myself. You never
allow that any one else has any responsibility when
things go wrong, and you never take the smallest
share of the responsibility&mdash;or the praise, rather&mdash;when
things go right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt laughed. In spite of her queer
earnestness over what seemed&mdash;at all events to
others&mdash;very little things, and her quite extraordinary
conscientiousness&mdash;some people indeed
might have called it scrupulosity&mdash;she had really
a keen sense of humour. She was always ready to
laugh at her own earnestness as soon as she perceived
it. She was not, however, always ready to
abandon it, unless it were quite, quite obvious
that she had really better do so. And then she did
it with a quick mental shake, and put an odd little
mocking humour in its place.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear, one generally is responsible,
and that just because my universe is so small,
as you justly pointed out. But I always believe
literally what any one says. I don&#8217;t in the least
mean that Pia said what was not true. Of course
she thought she had swept away the cobweb and
the bubble, and I&#8217;ve no doubt she did. But it left
a gap, as you said. I ought to have seen the gap
and tried to fill it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t, Tibby, if the bubble were the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
colour I fancy. Only the bubble itself, consolidated,
could do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, you mean&mdash;?&#8221; said Miss
Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that,&#8221; nodded Trix. &#8220;It was bound to
happen some time. Pia is made to give and
receive love. She was too young when she married
to know what it really meant. And, well, think of
those years of her married life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of them for seven years,&#8221; said Miss
Tibbutt quietly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve forgotten
them now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s eyes filled with quick tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you haven&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t mean that.
What I do mean is that I suppose she thought
she had got the real thing then, and all the young
happiness in it was destroyed in a moment. Then
came those seven terrible years. For an older
woman perhaps there would have been a self-sacrificing
joy in them; for Pia, there was just the
brave facing of an obvious duty. She was splendid,
of course she was splendid, but no one could
call it joy. Now, somehow, she&#8217;s had a glimpse
of what real joy might be. And it has vanished
again. I don&#8217;t know how I know, but it&#8217;s true.
I feel it in my bones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was a silence. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; asked Miss Tibbutt simply.</p>
<p>Trix laughed, though her eyes were grave.
&#8220;You, angel, can pray. Of course I shall, too.
But I&#8217;m going to do quite a lot of thinking, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
keeping my eyes open as well. And now I am
going right round this perfectly heavenly garden
once more, and then, I suppose, it will be time to
dress for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swinging herself off the table, she departed
waving her hand to Miss Tibbutt before she turned
a corner by a yew hedge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Trix,&#8221; murmured Miss Tibbutt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>MOONLIGHT AND THEORIES</h3>
</div>

<p>The little party of two men and two women
were assembled in the drawing-room. Trix had
not yet put in an appearance. But, then, the
dinner gong had not sounded. Trix invariably
saved her reputation for punctuality by appearing
on the last stroke.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt and Father Dormer were sitting
on the sofa; Pia was in an armchair near the open
window, and Doctor Hilary was standing on the
hearthrug. His dress clothes seemed to increase
his size, and he did not look perfectly at home in
them; or, perhaps, it was merely the fact that he
was so seldom seen in them. Doctor Hilary in a
shabby overcoat or loose tweeds, was the usual
sight.</p>
<p>Father Dormer was a tallish thin man, with
very aquiline features, and dark hair going grey
on his temples. At the moment he and Miss
Tibbutt were deep in a discussion on rose growing,
a favourite hobby of his. Deeply engrossed, they
were weighing the advantages of the scent of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
more old-fashioned kinds, against the shape and
colour of the newer varieties, with the solemnity
of two judges.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re pretty equally balanced in my garden,&#8221;
said Father Dormer. &#8220;I can&#8217;t do without
the old-fashioned ones, despite the beauty of the
newer sorts. I&#8217;ve two bushes of the red and white&mdash;the
York and Lancaster rose. I was a Lancashire
lad, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then the first soft notes of the gong sounded
from the hall, rising to a full boom beneath the
footman&#8217;s accomplished stroke.</p>
<p>There was a sound of running steps descending
the stairs, and a final jump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it going, Dale,&#8221; said a voice without.
And then Trix entered the room, slightly flushed
by her rapid descent of the stairs, but with an
assumption of leisurely dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not late,&#8221; she announced with great
innocence. &#8220;The gong hasn&#8217;t stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary, who was facing the door, looked
at her. He saw a small, elf-like girl in a very
shimmery green frock. The green enhanced
her elf-like appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deceiver,&#8221; laughed Pia. &#8220;We heard you
quite, quite distinctly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously caught, Trix echoed the laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow I&#8217;d have been in before the echo
stopped,&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>They went informally into the dining-room,
where the light of shaded wax candles on the table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
mingled with the departing daylight, for the curtains
were still undrawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this kind of light,&#8221; remarked Trix, as
she seated herself.</p>
<p>Trix almost always thought aloud. It meant
that conversation in her presence seldom flagged,
since her brain was rarely idle; though she could be
really marvellously silent when she perceived that
silence was desirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know this garden?&#8221; she said, addressing
herself to Doctor Hilary, by whom she was
seated.</p>
<p>He assented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t it lovely? That&#8217;s what made me
nearly late,&mdash;going round it again. I&#8217;ve been
round five times since yesterday. It&#8217;s just
heavenly after London. Roses <i>versus</i> petrol, you
know.&#8221; She wrinkled up her nose as she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to see the gardens of Chorley Old
Hall, Miss Devereux,&#8221; said Father Dormer. &#8220;Not
that I mean any invidious comparison between
them and this garden,&#8221; he added, with a little
smile towards the Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chorley Old Hall,&#8221; remarked Trix. &#8220;I used
to go there when I was a tiny child. There was a
man lived there, who used to terrify me out of my
wits, his eyes were so black. But I liked him,
when I got over my first fright. What has become
of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He died a short time ago,&#8221; said the Duchessa
quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Trix regretfully. Possibly she had
contemplated a renewal of the acquaintanceship.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d been an invalid for a long time,&#8221; explained
the Duchessa. She was a little, just a
trifle anxious as to whether the conversation might
not prove embarrassing for Doctor Hilary. There
was a feeling in the village that the journey, which
Doctor Hilary had permitted&mdash;some, indeed, said
advocated&mdash;had been entirely responsible for the
death.</p>
<p>But Doctor Hilary was eating his dinner, apparently
utterly and completely at his ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow the gardens aren&#8217;t being neglected,&#8221;
said Father Dormer. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got a new under-gardener
there who is proving rather a marvel in
his line. In fact Golding confesses that he&#8217;ll have
to look out for his own laurels. He&#8217;s a nice looking
fellow, this new man, and a cut above the
ordinary type, I should say. I used to see him in
church after Mass on Sundays at one time. But
he has given up coming lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; said the Duchessa.</p>
<p>Trix looked up quickly, surprised at the intonation
of her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he isn&#8217;t a Catholic,&#8221; smiled Father
Dormer. &#8220;Perhaps curiosity brought him in the
beginning, and now it has worn off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix was still looking at the Duchessa. She
couldn&#8217;t make out the odd intonation of her voice.
It had been indifferent enough to be almost rude.
But, if it were intended for a snub, Father Dormer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
had evidently not taken it as such. Yet there was
a little pause on the conclusion of his remark, almost
as if Doctor Hilary and Miss Tibbutt had had
the same idea as herself. At least, that was what
Trix felt the little pause to mean. And then she
was suddenly annoyed with herself for having felt
it. Of course it was quite absurd.</p>
<p>She looked down at her plate of clear soup.
It had letters of a white edible substance floating
in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an A and two S&#8217;s in my soup,&#8221; she
remarked pathetically. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is quite
tactful of the cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an instant lowering of eyes towards
soup plates, an announcing of the various letters
seen therein. Trix had an application for each,
making the letters stand as the initials for words.</p>
<p>&#8220;C. S.,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt presently, entering
into the spirit of the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure there isn&#8217;t a T?&#8221; asked Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt peering closer, &#8220;I
mean there isn&#8217;t one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, it can&#8217;t be Catholic Truth Society.
My imagination has given out. I can only
think of Christian Science. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
quite right of you, Tibby dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt blinked good-humouredly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they the people who think that the
Bible dropped down straight from heaven in a
shiny black cover with S. P. G. printed on it?&#8221; she
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>Trix shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she declared solemnly, &#8220;they&#8217;re Bible
Christians. The Christian Science people are the
ones who think we haven&#8217;t got any bodies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No bodies!&#8221; ejaculated Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Trix, &#8220;anyhow they think bodies
are a false&mdash;false something or other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;False claim,&#8221; suggested Father Dormer.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; cried Trix, immensely delighted.
&#8220;How clever of you to have thought of it. Only
I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s the bodies are a false claim, or
the aches attached to the bodies. Perhaps it&#8217;s
both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that was the New Thought Idea,&#8221;
said Pia.</p>
<p>Trix shook her head. &#8220;Oh no, the New
Thought people think a lot about one&#8217;s body.
They give us lots of bodies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; queried Doctor Hilary doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; responded Trix. &#8220;I once went to one
of their lectures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Trix!&#8221; ejaculated Miss Tibbutt
flustered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite an accident,&#8221; said Trix reassuringly.
&#8220;A friend of mine, Sybil Martin, was
coming up to town and wanted me to meet her.
She suggested I should meet her at Paddington,
and then go to a lecture on psychometry with her,
and tea afterwards. I hadn&#8217;t the faintest notion
what psychometry was, but I supposed it might
be first cousin to trigonometry, and quite as dull.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
But she wanted me, so I went. It <i>was</i> funny,&#8221;
gurgled Trix.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary was watching her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better disburden your mind,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trix crumbled her bread, still smiling at the
recollection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the lecture was held in a biggish room,
and there were a lot of odd people present. But
the oddest of all was the lecturer. She wore a kind
of purple velvet tea-gown, though it was only three
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. She talked for a long
time about vibrations, and things that bored me
awfully, and people kept interrupting with questions.
One man interrupted particularly often. He
kept saying, &#8216;Excuse me, but am I right in thinking&mdash;&#8217;
And then he would give a little lecture on
his own account, and look around for the approval
of the audience. I should have flung things at him
if I had been the purple velvet lady. It was so
obvious that he was not desiring <i>her</i> information,
but merely wishful to air his own. There was a
text on the wall which said, &#8216;We talk abundance
here,&#8217; and when I pointed out to Sybil how true it
was, she wasn&#8217;t a bit pleased, and said it didn&#8217;t
mean what I thought <i>in the least</i>. But she wouldn&#8217;t
explain what it did mean. After the lecture, the
purple velvet lady held things&mdash;jewelry chiefly&mdash;that
people in the audience sent up to her, and
described their owners, and where they&#8217;d got the
things from. There was quite a lot of family
history, and people&#8217;s characteristics and virtues
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and failings, and very, <i>very</i> private things made
public, but no one seemed to mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the odd thing about those people,&#8221; said
Doctor Hilary thoughtfully. &#8220;Disclosing their
innermost thoughts, feelings, and so-called experiences,
seems an absolute mania with them. And
the more public the disclosure the better they are
pleased. But go on, Miss Devereux.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Trix, &#8220;at last she began describing
a sort of Cleopatra lady, and&mdash;and rather vivid
love scenes, and&mdash;and things like that. When
she&#8217;d ended, the bracelet turned out to belong to a
little dowdy woman looking like a meek mouse.
I thought the purple velvet lady would have been
really upset and mortified at her mistake. But
she wasn&#8217;t in the least. She just smiled sweetly,
and returned the bracelet to the owner, and said
that the dowdy little woman had been Cleopatra
in a former incarnation. Of course when she
began on <i>that</i> tack, I saw the kind of lecture I&#8217;d
really let myself in for, and I knew I&#8217;d no business
to be in the place at all, so I made Sybil take me
away. It was nearly the end, and she didn&#8217;t mind,
because she missed the silver collection. But she
talked to me about it the whole of tea-time, and
she really believed it all,&#8221; sighed Trix pathetically.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt looked quite shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but, my dear, she couldn&#8217;t really.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did,&#8221; nodded Trix.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt appealed helplessly to Father
Dormer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why do people believe such extraordinary
things?&#8221; she demanded almost wrathfully.</p>
<p>Father Dormer laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s a question I
cannot pretend to answer. But I suppose that if
people reject the truth, and yet want to believe
something beyond mere physical facts, they can
invent anything, that is if they happen to be
endowed with sufficient imagination.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the devil must help them invent,&#8221; said
Miss Tibbutt with exceeding firmness.</p>
<p>After dinner they had coffee in the garden. A
big moon was coming up in the dusk behind the
trees, its light throwing the shadows dark and soft
on the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so astonishingly silent after London,&#8221;
said Trix, gazing at the blue-grey velvet of the
sky.</p>
<p>She looked more than ever elfin-like, with the
moonlight falling on her fair hair and pointed oval
face, and the shimmering green of her dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why we ever go to bed on moonlight
nights,&#8221; she pursued. &#8220;Brilliant sunshine always
tempts us to do something&mdash;a long walk, a drive,
or boating on a river. Over and over again we
say, &#8216;Now, the very next fine day we&#8217;ll do&mdash;so and
so.&#8217; But no one ever dreams of saying, &#8216;Now, the
next moonlight night we&#8217;ll have a picnic.&#8217; I
wonder why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Doctor Hilary smiling, and
watching her, &#8220;the old and staid folk have no desire
to lose their sleep, and&mdash;well, the conventions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
are apt to stand in the way of the young and
romantic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conventions,&#8221; sighed Trix, &#8220;are the bane of
one&#8217;s existence. They hamper all one&#8217;s most
cherished desires until one is of an age when the
desires become non-existent. My aunt Lilla is
always saying to me, &#8216;When you&#8217;re a much older
woman, dearest.&#8217; And I reply, &#8216;But, Aunt Lilla,
<i>now</i> is the moment.&#8217; I know, by experience, later
is no good. When I was a tiny child my greatest
desire was to play with all the grubbiest children
in the parks. Of course I was dragged past them
by a haughty and righteous nurse. I can talk to
them now if I want to, and even wheel their perambulators.
But it would have been so infinitely
nicer to wheel a very dirty baby in a very ramshackle
perambulator when I was eight. Conventions
are responsible for an enormous lot of
lost opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mightn&#8217;t they be well lost?&#8221; suggested Father
Dormer.</p>
<p>Trix looked across at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Serious or nonsense?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whichever you like,&#8221; he replied, a little
twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, serious,&#8221; interpolated Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>Trix leant a little forward, resting her chin
on her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, seriously then, conventions&mdash;those that
are merely conventions for their own sake,&mdash;are
detestable, and responsible for an enormous lot of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
unhappiness. &#8216;My dear (mimicked Trix), you can
be quite polite to so and so, but I cannot have you
becoming friendly with them, you know they are
not <i>quite</i>.&#8217; I&#8217;ve heard that said over and over
again. It&#8217;s hateful. I&#8217;m not a socialist, not one
little bit, but I do think if you like a person you
ought to be able to be friends, even if you happen
to be a Duchess and he&#8217;s a chimney-sweep. The
motto of the present-day world is, &#8216;What will
people think?&#8217; People!&#8221; snorted Trix wrathfully,
warming to her theme, &#8220;what people? And is their
opinion worth twopence halfpenny? Fancy them
associating with St. Peter if he appeared now
among them as he used to be, with only his goodness
and his character and his fisherman&#8217;s clothes,
instead of his halo and his keys, as they see him in
the churches.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men laughed. Miss Tibbutt made a
little murmur of something like query. The
Duchessa&#8217;s face looked rather white, but perhaps
it was only the effect of the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Miss Devereux,&#8221; said Doctor Hilary,
&#8220;even now the world&mdash;people, as you call them,
are quite ready to recognize genius despite the fact
that it may have risen from the slums.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; contended Trix eagerly, &#8220;but it&#8217;s not
the person they recognize really, it&#8217;s merely their
adjunct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Miss Tibbutt.
Father Dormer smiled comprehendingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Trix slowly, &#8220;they recognize the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
thing that makes the show, and the person because
of that thing, not for the person&#8217;s own self. Let
me try and explain better. A man, born in the
slums, has a marvellous voice. He becomes a
noted singer. He&#8217;s received everywhere and
fêted. But it&#8217;s really his voice that is fêted, because
it is the fashion to fête it. Let him lose his
voice, and he drops out of existence. People
don&#8217;t recognize him himself, the self which gave
expression to the voice, and which still <i>is</i>, even
after the voice is dumb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Dormer nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; went on Trix, &#8220;I maintain that that
man is every bit as well worth knowing afterwards,&mdash;after
he has lost his voice. And even if he&#8217;d
never been able to give expression to himself by
singing, he might have been just as well worth
knowing. But the world never looks for inside
things, but only for external things that make
a show. So if Mrs. B. hasn&#8217;t an atom of anything
congenial to me in her composition, but has
a magnificent house and heaps of money, it&#8217;s
quite right and fitting I should know her, so
people would say, and encourage me to do so.
But it&#8217;s against all the conventions that I should
be friendly with little Miss F. who lives over the
tobacconist&#8217;s at the corner of such and such a
street, though she <i>is</i> thoroughly congenial to me,
and I love her plucky and cheery outlook on life.&#8221;
She stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; encouraged Doctor Hilary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Trix, &#8220;take a more extreme
case. Sir A. C. is&mdash;well, not a bad man, but not
the least the kind of man I care about, but he may
take me in to dinner, and, on the strength of that
brief acquaintance, to a theatre if he wants, provided
I have some other woman with me as a sort
of chaperon, and he can talk to me by the hour,
and that all on account of his money and title.
Mr. Z. is a really white man, but he&#8217;s a &#8216;come-down,&#8217;
through no fault of his own, and a bus-conductor.
I happen to have spoken to him once
or twice; and like him. But I mightn&#8217;t even walk
for half an hour with him in the park, if I&#8217;d fifty
authorized chaperons attending on me. That&#8217;s
what I mean about conventions that are conventions
for their own sake.&#8221; She stopped again.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you suggest as a remedy?&#8221; asked
Father Dormer, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t one,&#8221; sighed Trix. &#8220;At least
not one you can apply universally. Everybody
must just apply it for themselves, and not exactly
by defying conventions, but by treating them as
simply non-existent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa made a little movement in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;comes to exactly
the same thing as defying them, and it won&#8217;t
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d find yourself curiously lonely after a
time if you did.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean my friends&mdash;no, my acquaintances&mdash;would
desert me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d have the one I&#8217;d chanced it all for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Duchessa slowly and deliberately,
&#8220;but you&#8217;d have to be very sure, not only
that the friend was worth it, but that you were
worth it to the friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was rather a blank silence. Trix gave a
little gasp. It was not so much the words that
hurt, as the tone in which they had been spoken.
It was a repetition of the little scene at dinner,
but this time intensified. And it was so utterly,
so entirely unlike Pia. Trix felt miserably
squashed. She had been talking a good deal too,
perhaps, indeed, rather foolishly, that was the
worst of it. No doubt she <i>had</i> made rather an
idiot of herself. She swallowed a little lump in her
throat. Well, anyhow that inflection in Pia&#8217;s
tone must be covered at once. That was the
first, indeed the only, consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of all those contingencies,&#8221;
she laughed. There was the faintest suspicion
of a quiver in her voice. &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about the
moonlight. But it was the moonlight began it
all.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Two hours later the garden lay deserted in the
same moonlight.</p>
<p>A woman was sitting by an open window,
looking out into the garden. She had been sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
there quite a long time. Suddenly her eyes
filled with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Trix, Trix,&#8221; she said half aloud, &#8220;if only
it would work. But it won&#8217;t. And it was the
moonlight that began it all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>ON THE MOORLAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Trix was walking over the moorland. The
Duchessa and Miss Tibbutt had departed to what
promised to be an exceedingly dull garden party
some five miles distant. It had been decreed that
it was entirely unnecessary to inflict the same probable
dulness on Trix, therefore she had been
left to freedom and her own devices for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Trix was playing the game of &#8220;I remember.&#8221;
It can be a quite extraordinarily fascinating game,
or an exceedingly painful one. Trix was finding
it extraordinarily fascinating. It was so gorgeously
delightful to find that nothing had shrunk,
nothing lessened in beauty or mystery. A larch
copse was every bit as much a haunt of the Little
People as formerly; the moss every bit as much a
cool green carpet for their tripping feet. A few
belated foxglove stems added to the old-time
enchantment of the place. Even a little stream
rippling through the wood, was a veritable stream,
and not merely a watery ditch, as it might quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
well have proved. Then there was the view from
the gate, through a frame of beech trees out towards
the sea. It was still as entrancing an ocean,
sun-flecked and radiant. There were still as
infinite possibilities in the unknown Beyond,
could one have chartered a white-winged boat,
and have sailed to where land and water meet.
There was a pond, too, surrounded by blackberry
bushes and great spear-like rushes, perhaps not
quite the enormous lake of one&#8217;s childhood, but a
reasonably large pond enough, and there were
still the blackberry bushes and the spear-like
rushes. And, finally, there was the moorland,
glowing with more radiant crimson lakes and
madders than the most wonderful paint box
ever held, and stretching up and down, and up
again, till it melted in far away purples and
lavenders.</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s heart sang in accord with the laughing
sun-kissed earth around her. It was all so gorgeous,
so free and untrammelled. She lay upon
the hot springy heather, and crushed the tiny purple
flowers of the wild thyme between her fingers,
raising the bruised petals to her face to drink
in their strong sweet scent.</p>
<p>From far off she could hear the tinkle of a
goat bell, and the occasional short bark of a sheep
dog. All else was silence, save for the humming of
the bees above the heather. Tiny insects floated
in the still air, looking like specks of thistle-down as
the sun caught and silvered their minute wings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Little blue butterflies flitted hither and thither
like radiant animated flowers.</p>
<p>For a long time Trix sat very still, body and
soul bathed in the beauty around her. At last she
got to her feet, and made her way across the
heather, ignoring the small beaten tracks despite
the prickliness of her chosen route.</p>
<p>After some half-hour&#8217;s walking she came to a
stone wall bordering a hilly field, a low wall, a
battered wall, where tiny ferns grew in the crevices,
and the stones themselves were patched with
orange-coloured lichen.</p>
<p>Trix climbed the wall, and walked across the
soft grass. A good way to the right was a fence,
and beyond the fence a wood. Trix made her
way slowly towards it. Thistles grew among the
grass,&mdash;carding thistles, and thistles with small
drooping heads. She looked at them idly as she
walked. Suddenly a slight sound behind her made
her turn, and with the turning her heart leapt to
her throat.</p>
<p>From over the brow of the hilly field behind
her, quite a number of cattle were coming at a
fair pace towards her.</p>
<p>Now Trix hated cows in any shape or form,
and these were the unpleasant white-faced, brown
cattle, whose very appearance is against them.
They were moving quickly too, quite alarmingly
quickly.</p>
<p>Trix cast one terrified and pathetic glance over
her shoulder. The glance was all-sufficient. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
ran,&mdash;ran straight for the wood, the cattle after
her. Doubtless curiosity, mere enquiry maybe,
prompted their pursuit. Trix concerned herself not
at all with the motive, the fact was all-sufficient.
Fear lent wings to her feet, and with the horned
and horrid beasts still some ten yards behind her,
she precipitated herself across the fence to fall in
an undignified but wholly relieved heap among a
mass of bracken and whortleberry bushes. The
briefest of moments saw her once more on her
feet, struggling, fighting her way through shoulder-high
bracken. Five minutes brought her to an
open space beyond. Trembling, breathless, and
most suspiciously near tears, she sank upon the
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beasts!&#8221; ejaculated Trix opprobriously,
and not as the mere statement of an obvious
fact. She took off her hat, which flight had flung
to a somewhat rakish angle, and blinked vigorously
towards the trees. She was <i>not</i> going to cry.</p>
<p>Presently fright gave place to interest. She
gazed around, curious, speculative. It was an
unusual wood, a strange wood, a wood of holly
trees, with a scattered sprinkling of beech trees.
The grey twisted trunks of the hollies gleamed
among the dark foliage, giving an eerie and almost
uncanny atmosphere to the place. It was extraordinarily
silent, too; and infinitely lonelier than
the deserted moorland. It gave Trix an odd
feeling of unpleasant mystery. Yet there was
nothing for it but to face the mystery, to see if she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
could not find some way out further adown the
wood. Not for untold gold would she again have
faced those horned beasts behind her.</p>
<p>A tiny narrow path led downhill from the
cleared space. Trix set off down it, swinging her
hat airily by the brim the while. Presently the
sense of uncanniness abated somewhat; the elfin
in her went out to meet the weirdness of the wood.</p>
<p>Now and again she stopped to pick and eat
whortleberries from the massed bushes beneath the
trees. She did not particularly like them, truly;
nevertheless she was still young enough to pick and
eat what nature had provided for picking and eating,
and that for the mere pleasure of being able
to do so. Also, at this juncture the action brought
confidence in its train.</p>
<p>Presently, through the trees facing her, she
saw a wall, a high wall, a brick wall, and quite
evidently bordering civilization.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t go on for ever,&#8221; considered Trix.
&#8220;It must come to an end some time, either right,
or left. And I&#8217;m not going back.&#8221; This last
exceedingly firmly.</p>
<p>She went forward, scrutinizing, anxious. And
then,&mdash;joyful and welcome sight!&mdash;a door, an open
door came into view. A mound of half-carted leaf
mould just without showed, to any one endowed
with even the meanest powers of deduction, that
someone&mdash;some man, probably&mdash;was busy in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Trix made hastily for the door. The next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
moment she was through it, to find herself face to
face with a man and a wheelbarrow. Trix came
to a standstill, a standstill at once sudden and
unpremeditated. The man dropped the wheelbarrow.
They stared blankly at each other.
And Trix was far too flustered to realize that
his stare was infinitely more amazed than her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t come through this way,&#8221; said the
man, decisive though bewildered. His orders regarding
the non-entrance of strangers had been
of the emphatic kind.</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s brain worked rapidly. The route before
her must lead to safety, and nothing, no power
on earth, would take her back through the field
atop the wood. She was genuinely, quite genuinely
too frightened. This is by way of excuse,
since here a regrettable fact must be recorded.
Trix gave vent to a sound closely resembling
a sneeze. It was followed by one brief sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s someone at the gate,&#8221; was what the
man heard.</p>
<p>Again amazement was written on his face. He
turned towards the gate. Trix fled past him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t go back,&#8221; she insisted to herself,
as she vanished round the corner of a big green-house.
&#8220;And I <i>did</i> say &#8216;isn&#8217;t there&#8217; even if it was
mixed up with a sneeze. And wherever have I
seen that man&#8217;s face before?&#8221;</p>
<p>She whisked round another corner of the green-house,
attempting no answer to her query at the
moment, ran down a long cinder path bordered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
by cabbages and gooseberry bushes, and bolted
through another door in another wall. And here
Trix found herself in an orchard, at the bottom of
which was a yew hedge wherein she espied a wicket
gate. She made rapid way towards it. And now
she saw a big grey house facing her. There was no
mistaking it. Childhood&#8217;s memories rushed upon
her. It was Chorley Old Hall.</p>
<p>Trix came through the wicket gate, and out
upon a lawn, in the middle of which was a great
marble basin full of crystal water, from which rose
a little silver fountain. Before her was the big
grey house, melancholy, deserted-looking. The
blinds were drawn down in most of the windows.
It had the appearance of a house in which death
was present.</p>
<p>And then a spirit of curiosity fell upon her, a
sudden strong desire to see within the house, to go
once more into the rooms where she had stood in
the old days, a small and somewhat frightened
child.</p>
<p>There was not a soul in sight. Probably the
man with the wheelbarrow had not thought it
worth while to pursue her. The garden appeared
as deserted as the house. Trix tip-toed cautiously
towards it. She looked like a kitten or a canary
approaching a dead elephant.</p>
<p>To her left was a door. Quite probably it was
locked; but then, by the favour of fortune, it
might not be. Of course she ran a risk, a considerable
risk of meeting some caretaker or other, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
her presence would not be particularly easy to
explain. Curiosity and prudence wavered momentarily
in the balance. Curiosity turned the
scale. She tried the door. Vastly to her delight it
yielded at her push. She slipped inside the house,
closing it softly behind her.</p>
<p>She found herself in a long carpeted passage,
sporting prints adorning the walls. She tip-toed
down it, her step making no smallest sound on the
soft carpet. The end of the passage brought her
into a big square hall. To her right were wide
deep stairs; opposite them was a door, in all
probability the front door; to her left was another
door.</p>
<p>Trix recalled the past, rapidly, and in detail.
The door to the left must lead to the library,&mdash;that
is, if her memory did not play her false. She
remembered the big room, the book-cases reaching
from floor to ceiling, and the man with the black
eyes, who had terrified her. Something, some
fleeting shadow, of her old childish fear was upon
her now, as she turned the door handle. The door
yielded easily. She pushed it wide open.</p>
<p>The room was shadowed, gloomy almost. The
heavy curtains were drawn back from the windows,
but other curtains of some thinnish green
material hung before them, curtains which effectually
blotted out any view from the window, or view
into the room from without. Before her were the
old remembered book-cases, filled with dark, rather
fusty books.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>Trix pushed the door to behind her, and turned,
nonchalantly, to look around the room. As she
looked her heart jumped, leapt, and then stood
still.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AN OLD MAN IN A LIBRARY</h3>
</div>

<p>A white-haired man was watching her. He
was sitting in a big oak chair, his hands resting on
the arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; ejaculated Trix. And further expression
failed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t let me disturb you,&#8221; came a
suave, courteous old voice. &#8220;You were looking
for something perhaps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wanted to see the library,&#8221; stuttered
Trix, flabbergasted, dismayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is the library. May I ask how you
found your way in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through a door,&#8221; responded Trix, voicing the
obvious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! I did not know visitors were being admitted
to the house?&#8221; This on a note of interrogation,
flavoured with the faintest hint of irony,
though the courtesy was still not lacking.</p>
<p>Trix coloured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t admitted,&#8221; she owned. &#8220;I just
came.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I see,&#8221; said the white-haired man still
courteously. &#8220;You perhaps were not aware that
your presence might be an&mdash;er, an intrusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Trix coloured.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man did tell me I couldn&#8217;t come through this
way,&#8221; she confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet he allowed you to do so?&#8221; There was a
queer note beneath the courtesy.</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s ear, catching the note, found it almost
repellant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t his fault,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I came.
I said, &#8216;Isn&#8217;t there someone at the gate?&#8217; And
while he turned to look, I ran. At least,&mdash;&#8221; a
gleam of laughter sprang to her eyes&mdash;&#8220;I sneezed
first, so it sounded like &#8216;There&#8217;s somebody at the
gate.&#8217; So he thought there was really. It&mdash;it
was rather mean of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you might call an acted lie,&#8221; suggested
the man.</p>
<p>Trix looked conscience-stricken, contrite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it was,&#8221; she admitted in a very
small voice. &#8220;But it was the cows. Only I think
they were bulls. I <i>am</i> so frightened of cows. I
couldn&#8217;t go back. And he wasn&#8217;t going to let
me through. It wasn&#8217;t his fault a bit, it wasn&#8217;t
really. I know I told a&mdash;a kind of lie.&#8221; She
sighed heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>Again Trix sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never make a martyr, would I? Only&#8221;&mdash;a
degree more hopefully&mdash;&#8220;A sneeze isn&#8217;t quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
like denying real things, things that matter, is it?&#8221;
This last was spoken distinctly appealingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a theologian,&#8221; said the man dryly.</p>
<p>Trix looked at him. A sudden light of illumination
passed over her face, giving place to absolute
amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you Mr. Danver?&#8221; she ejaculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of his being a theologian,&#8221; was
the retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Danver is dead!&#8221; gasped Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Trix dazed, bewildered, &#8220;he
evidently isn&#8217;t. But why on earth did you&mdash;&#8221; she
broke off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I what?&#8221; he demanded with a queer
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say you were dead?&#8221; asked Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead men, my dear young lady, tell no tales,
nor have I ever heard of a living one proclaiming
his own demise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix laughed involuntarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow you&#8217;ve let other people say you are,&#8221;
she retorted.</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you let them?&#8221; asked Trix.</p>
<p>Again the man shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no responsibility in the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Hilary has, then,&#8221; she flashed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he?&#8221; was the quiet response.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has told people you were dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s let them think so anyway. Why
has he?&#8221; demanded Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ask a good many questions for an&mdash;er&mdash;an
intruder,&#8221; remarked the man.</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s chin went up. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I apologize.
I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;Sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix sat down near a table. She looked straight
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;what do you want to say to
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Nicholas Danver,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was quite sure of that,&#8221; nodded Trix. She
was recovering her self-possession.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had an excellent reason for allowing people
to imagine I was dead,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;as excellent
a one, perhaps, as yours for your&mdash;your unexpected
appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t say &#8216;intrusion&#8217; again,&#8221;
said Trix thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Nicholas gave a short laugh.</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Hilary must have told a dreadful lot
of lies,&#8221; said Trix slowly and not a little regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said Nicholas, &#8220;he told
none.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Nicholas, &#8220;it&#8217;s quite an interesting
little history in its way. You can stop me if I
bore you.... Doctor Hilary says, in the hearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
of a housemaid, that it might be a good plan to
consult a specialist. It is announced in the village
that the Squire is going to consult a specialist.
Doctor Hilary travels up to town with an empty
litter. The village announces that he has taken
the Squire to the specialist. He returns alone.
The station-master asks him when the Squire
will return from London. He is briefly told,
never. The village announces the Squire&#8217;s demise.
I don&#8217;t say that certain little further incidents
did not lend colour to the idea, such as the
Squire confining himself entirely to two rooms, and
allowing the butler alone of the servants to see
him; Doctor Hilary&#8217;s dismissal of the other indoor
servants on his return to town; the deserted appearance
of the house. But from first to last there
was less actual direct lying in the matter, than in&mdash;shall
I say, than in a simple sneeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>A third time the colour mounted in Trix&#8217;s
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not let me forget <i>that</i>,&#8221; she said pathetically.
&#8220;But why ever did you want everyone to
think you were dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas looked towards the window thoughtfully,
ruminatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;That, my dear young lady, is my own affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Trix quickly. She
lapsed into silence. Suddenly she looked up, an
elfin smile of pure mischief dancing in her eyes.
&#8220;And now I know you&#8217;re not dead,&#8221; she remarked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Nicholas. &#8220;You know I&#8217;m
not dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; demanded Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course you can go and publish the
news to the world,&#8221; he remarked smoothly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And equally of course,&#8221; retorted Trix, &#8220;I shall
do nothing of the kind. Quite possibly you mayn&#8217;t
trust me, because&mdash;because I <i>did</i> sneeze. But
honestly I didn&#8217;t have time to think properly
then, at least, only time to think how to get out of
the difficulty, and not time to think about fairness
or anything. I truly don&#8217;t tell lies generally. And
to tell about you would be like telling what was
in a private letter if you&#8217;d read it by accident, so
<i>of course</i> I shan&#8217;t say a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas held out his hand without speaking.
Trix got up from her chair, and put her own warm
hand into his cold one.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said in an oddly gentle voice.
&#8220;And you can speak to Doctor Hilary about it if
you like. You&#8217;ll no doubt need a safety valve.&#8221;
He looked again at her, still holding her hand.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I seen you before?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Trix nodded. &#8220;When I was a tiny child. My
name is Trix Devereux. I used to come here with
my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Nicholas, &#8220;Jack Devereux&#8217;s
daughter! How is the old fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He died five years ago,&#8221; said Trix softly.</p>
<p>Nicholas dropped her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I live on,&#8221; he said grimly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
queer world.&#8221; He looked down at the black dressing
gown which hid his useless legs. &#8220;Bah,
where&#8217;s the use of sentiment at this time of day.
Anyhow it&#8217;s a pleasure to meet you, even though
your entrance was a bit of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An intrusion,&#8221; smiled Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to say a surprise,&#8221; said Nicholas
courteously. &#8220;And now you must allow me to
give you some tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but,&#8221; she demurred, &#8220;the butler will see
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a very pleasant sight for him,&#8221; responded
Nicholas, &#8220;if you will permit an old man to pay
you a compliment. Besides Jessop is used to
holding his tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can quite well imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas pressed the electric button attached
to the arm of his chair. He watched the door, a
curious amusement in his eyes.</p>
<p>Trix attempted an appearance of utter unconcern,
nevertheless she could not avoid a reflection
or two regarding the butler&#8217;s possible views on her
presence.</p>
<p>During the few seconds of waiting, she surveyed
the room. It was extraordinarily familiar. Nothing
was altered from her childish days. The
very position of the furniture was the same. There
were the same heavy brocaded curtains to the
windows, the same morocco-covered chairs, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
same thick Aubusson carpet, the same book-cases
lined with rather fusty books, the same great dogs
in the fireplace.</p>
<p>Nicholas looked at her, observing her survey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all so exactly the same,&#8221; responded Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never cared for change,&#8221; said Nicholas
shortly.</p>
<p>And then the door opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessop,&#8221; said Nicholas smooth-voiced, &#8220;Will
you kindly bring tea for me and this young lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flicker, a very faint flicker of amazement
passed over the man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he responded, and turned from the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;An excellent servant,&#8221; remarked Nicholas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Trix reflectively, &#8220;how they
manage to see everything, and look as if they saw
nothing. When I see things it&#8217;s perfectly obvious
to everyone else I am seeing them. I&mdash;I <i>look</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do most people,&#8221; returned Nicholas.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When, some half-hour later, Trix rose to take
leave, Nicholas again held out his hand. &#8220;I
believe I&#8217;d ask you to come and pay me another
visit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it would be wiser not. It is
not easy for&mdash;er, dead men to receive visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you hadn&#8217;t&mdash;died,&#8221; said Trix impulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that?&#8221; asked Nicholas curiously.</p>
<p>Trix nodded. There was an odd lump in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
throat, a lump that for the moment prevented
her from speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer child,&#8221; smiled Nicholas.</p>
<p>The tears welled up suddenly in Trix&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so lonely,&#8221; she said, with a half-sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;My own doing,&#8221; responded Nicholas.</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t make it nicer, but worse,&#8221; gulped
Trix.</p>
<p>Nicholas held her hand tighter.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, it&#8217;s better. It&#8217;s my own
choice.&#8221; He emphasized the last word a little.</p>
<p>Trix was silent. Nicholas let go her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let yourself out the front way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
am sorry I am unable to accompany you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix went slowly to the library door. At the
door she turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It mayn&#8217;t be right of me,&#8221; she announced,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m glad, really glad I did sneeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be perfectly candid,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;so
am I.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>ANTONY FINDS A GLOVE</h3>
</div>

<p>Trix&#8217;s appearance at the door in the wall had
fairly dumbfounded Antony. He had recognized
her instantly. And the amazing thing was that
she was exactly as he had seen her in his dream.
Her announcement had carried the dream sense
further, and it was with a queer feeling of intense
disappointment that he found no one standing outside
the gate. There was nothing but the silent
deserted wood and the mound of leaf-mould.
For a moment or so he stood listening, almost
expecting to hear a footstep among the trees.
Nothing but silence greeted him, however, broken
only by the faint rustling of the leaves.</p>
<p>He turned back to the garden. It was empty.
There was nothing, nothing on earth to prove that
the whole thing had not been an extraordinarily
vivid waking dream. And if it were a dream,
surely it was calculated to dispel the relief the
first dream had brought him. Yet was it a dream?
Could it have been? Wasn&#8217;t he entirely awake,
and in the possession of his right senses?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>Demanding thus of his soul, solemn, bewildered,
and reflective, he turned once more to his wheelbarrow.
Ten minutes later, trundling it down a
cinder path, his eye fell on an object lying beneath
a gooseberry bush. He dropped the barrow, and
picked up the object.</p>
<p>It was a long soft doe-skin glove.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a dream,&#8221; said Antony triumphantly.
&#8220;But where in the name of all that&#8217;s wonderful
did she come from? And where did she vanish
to?&#8221;</p>
<p>He put the glove into his pocket, and resumed
his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; he remarked to himself as he
heaved the leaf-mould out of the barrow, &#8220;that she
knew perfectly well there was no one at the gate.
I wonder why she said there was, and why, above
all, she made such an extraordinarily unexpected
appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>These considerations engrossed his mind for at
least the next half-hour, when, the leaf-mould
having been transported from the wood, he went
round to the front of the house to trim the edges of
the lawn. He was on his knees on the gravel
path, busily engaged with a pair of shears, when
he heard the amazing sound of the front door
opening and shutting. He looked round over his
shoulder, to see the same apparition that had
appeared to him from the wood, walking calmly
down the steps and in the direction of the drive.
Apparently she was too engrossed with her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
thoughts to observe him where he was kneeling at a
little distance to the eastward of the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; ejaculated Antony bewildered. And
he gazed after her.</p>
<p>It was not till her white dress had become a
speck in the distance, that Antony remembered
the long soft glove reposing in his pocket. He
dropped his shears, and bolted after her.</p>
<p>Trix was half-way down the drive, when she
heard rapid steps behind her. She looked back, to
see that she was being pursued by the young man
who had formerly been trundling a wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>Her first instinct was one of flight. Her second,
conscious that the owner of the property had condoned
her intrusion, and also having in view the
fact that there was nowhere but straight ahead to
run, and he was in all probability fleeter of foot
than she, was to stand her ground, and that as
unconcernedly as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; queried Trix with studied calmness, as
he came up to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Miss, but you dropped this in the
kitchen garden.&#8221; Antony held out the long soft
glove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you,&#8221; said Trix, infinitely relieved
that his rapid approach had signified nothing
worse than the restoration of her own lost property.
And then she looked at him. Where on earth had
she seen him before?</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any one at the gate, Miss,&#8221; said
Antony suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>Trix flushed. &#8220;Oh, wasn&#8217;t there? I&mdash;&#8221; she
broke off.</p>
<p>Then she looked straight at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew there wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;But I
was afraid to go back, so I had to make you look
away while I ran. It was the cows.&#8221; She sighed.
She felt she had been making bovine explanations
during the greater part of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cows, Miss?&#8221; queried Antony, a twinkle in his
eyes.</p>
<p>Trix nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; awful beasts with white faces, in the
field above the wood. I&#8217;m not sure they weren&#8217;t
bulls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, and why weren&#8217;t you telling me, then?
I&#8217;d have tackled them for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of that way out of the difficulty,&#8221;
she owned. &#8220;But it will be all right, I
ex&mdash;&#8221; She broke off. She had been within an
ace of saying she had explained matters to Mr.
Danver. She really must be careful. &#8220;I expect&mdash;I&#8217;m
sure you won&#8217;t get into trouble about it,&#8221; she
stuttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said, a trifle puzzled.</p>
<p>There was a queer pleasure in this little renewal
of the acquaintanceship of the bygone days,
despite the fact of its being an entirely one-sided
renewal. He&#8217;d have known her anywhere. It was
the same small vivacious face, the same odd little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
upward tilt to the chin, the same varied inflection
of voice, the same little quick gestures. He would
have liked to keep her standing there while he
recalled the small imperious child in the elfin-like
figure before him. But, her property having been
restored, there was nothing on earth further he
could say, no possible reason for prolonging the
conversation. He waited, however, for Trix
to give the dismissal.</p>
<p>Trix was looking at him, a queer puzzlement in
her eyes. Why <i>was</i> his face so oddly familiar? It
was utterly impossible that she should have met
him before, at all events on the intimate footing
the familiarity of his face suggested. It must be
merely an extraordinary likeness to someone to
whom she could not at the moment put a name.
Quite suddenly she realized that they were scrutinizing
each other in a way that certainly cannot
be termed exactly orthodox. She pulled herself
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for restoring my glove,&#8221; said she
with a fine resumption of dignity; and she turned
off once more down the drive.</p>
<p>Antony went slowly back to his shears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>AN INTEREST IN LIFE</h3>
</div>

<p>Doctor Hilary was walking down the lane in a
somewhat preoccupied frame of mind. He had
been oddly preoccupied the last day or so, lapsing
into prolonged meditations from which he would
emerge with a sudden and almost guilty start.</p>
<p>Coming opposite the drive gates of Chorley Old
Hall, he was brought to a sense of his surroundings
by a figure, which emerged suddenly from them
and came to a dead stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; ejaculated Doctor Hilary. &#8220;Good afternoon.&#8221;
And he took off his cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; responded Trix. She turned
along the lane beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been interviewing the gardens?&#8221; he
asked. She fancied there was the faintest trace of
anxiety in his voice.</p>
<p>A sudden spirit of mischief took possession of
Trix. She had been given leave. It was really too
good an opportunity to be lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; she responded, dove-like innocence in
her voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been having tea with Mr.
Danver.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>If she wanted to see amazement written on his
face, she had her desire. It spread itself large
over his countenance, finding verbal expression in
an utterly astounded gasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems very well,&#8221; said Trix demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Devereux!&#8221; ejaculated Doctor Hilary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; asked Trix sweetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you known all the time?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>Trix shook her head, laughter dancing in her
eyes. It found its way to her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you looked so surprised,&#8221; she gurgled.
&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t the tiniest bit of an idea. How could I?
I was never so flummuxed in all my life as when I
realized who was talking to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary was silent.</p>
<p>Trix put her hand on his arm, half timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t.
And I&#8217;ve promised faithfully not to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary glanced down at the hand on his
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not angry,&#8221; he said with a queer smile,
&#8220;I&#8217;m only&mdash;&#8221; He stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flummuxed, like I was,&#8221; nodded Trix, removing
her hand. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite the amazingest thing
I ever knew.&#8221; She gave another little gurgle of
laughter, looking up at the very blue sky as if
inviting it to share her pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much did he tell you?&#8221; asked Doctor
Hilary.</p>
<p>Trix lowered her chin, and considered briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just nothing, now I come to think of it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
beyond the fact that he was Mr. Danver. But
then I&#8217;d really been the first to volunteer that
piece of information. I haven&#8217;t the faintest
notion why there&#8217;s all this mystery, and why he
has pretended to be dead. He didn&#8217;t want me
to know that. So please don&#8217;t say anything that
could tell me. He said I could talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; smiled Doctor Hilary answering the
request.</p>
<p>They walked on a few steps in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what I should like to know,&#8221; he said
after a minute, &#8220;is how you managed to get inside
the house at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; sighed Trix twisting her glove round
her wrist.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary looked rather surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say if you&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; he remarked
quickly.</p>
<p>Trix sighed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I may as well. It will only be the third
time I&#8217;ve had to own up.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she proceeded with a careful recapitulation
of the events of the afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have been very frightened,&#8221; said he
as she ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; owned Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well; it&#8217;s all over now,&#8221; he comforted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes,&#8221; said Trix doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s troubling you?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sneeze,&#8221; confessed Trix in a very small
voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Doctor Hilary stifled a sudden spasm of laughter.
She was so utterly and entirely in earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry over a little thing like that, if
I were you,&#8221; said he consolingly.</p>
<p>Once more Trix sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s absurd,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know
it&#8217;s absurd. But, somehow, little things do worry
me, even when I know they&#8217;re silly. And there&#8217;s
just enough that&#8217;s not silliness in this to let it be a
real worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A genuine midge bite,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;But,
you know, rubbing it only makes it worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed a trifle shakily.</p>
<p>&#8220;And honestly,&#8221; he pursued, &#8220;though I do
understand your&mdash;your conscience in the matter,
I&#8217;m really very glad you&#8217;ve seen Mr. Danver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so was I,&#8221; owned Trix.</p>
<p>Again there was a silence. They were walking
down a narrow lane bordered on either side with
high banks and hedges. The dust lay rather
thick on the grass and leaves. It had already
covered their shoes with its grey powder. Doctor
Hilary was turning certain matters in his mind.
Presently he gave voice to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is exceedingly good for him that someone
besides myself and the butler and his wife should
know that he is alive, and that he should know they
do know it. I agreed to this mad business because
I believed it would give him an interest in living,
eccentric though the interest might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix gurgled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds so odd,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;to hear you
say that pretending to be dead could give any one
an interest in life.&#8221; And she gurgled again.
Trix&#8217;s gurgling was peculiarly infectious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Odd!&#8221; laughed Doctor Hilary. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
oddest thing imaginable. No one but Nick could
have conceived the whole business, or found the
smallest interest in it. But he did find an interest,
and that was enough for me. He is lonely
now, I grant. But before this&mdash;this invention, he
was stagnant as well as lonely. His mind, and
seemingly his soul with it, had become practically
atrophied. His mind has now been roused to
interest, though the most extraordinarily eccentric
interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And his soul?&#8221; queried Trix simply.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They parted company at the door of Doctor
Hilary&#8217;s house. Trix went on slowly down the
road. She paused opposite the presbytery, before
turning to the left in the direction of Woodleigh.
She rang the bell, and asked to see Father
Dormer.</p>
<p>He came to her in the little parlour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Trix, getting up as he entered, &#8220;I
only came to ask you to say a Mass for my intention.
And, please, will you say one every week till
I ask you to stop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; he responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Trix. Then she glanced at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
a clock on the mantelpiece. &#8220;I had no idea it was
so late,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She walked home at a fair pace. The midge
bite had ceased to worry her. But then, at Doctor
Hilary&#8217;s suggestion, she had ceased to rub it. She
was thinking of only one thing now, of a solitary
old figure in a large and gloomy library.</p>
<p>She sighed heavily once or twice. Well, at all
events she had asked for Masses for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>PRICKLES</h3>
</div>

<p>If you happen to have anything on your mind,
it is impossible&mdash;or practically impossible&mdash;to
avoid thinking about it. Which, doubtless, is so
obvious a fact, it is barely worth stating.</p>
<p>The Duchessa di Donatello had something on
her mind; it possessed her waking thoughts, it
coloured her dreams. And what that something
was, is also, perhaps, entirely obvious. Again
and again she told herself that she would not dwell
on the subject; but she might as well have tried
to dam a river with a piece of tissue paper, as
prevent the thought from filling her mind; and that
probably because&mdash;with true feminine inconsistency&mdash;she
welcomed it quite as much as she tried
to dispel it.</p>
<p>Occasionally she allowed it free entry, regarded
it, summed it up as unsatisfactory, and sternly dismissed
it. In three minutes it was welling up
again, perhaps in the same old route, perhaps
choosing a different course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t I put the man and everything concerning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
him out of my mind for good and all?&#8221;
she asked herself more than once. And, whatever
the reply to her query, the fact remained that she
couldn&#8217;t; the thought had become something of an
obsession.</p>
<p>Now, when a thought has become an obsession,
there is practically only one way to free oneself
from it, and that is by speech. Speech has a way
of clearing the clogged channels of the mind, and
allowing the thought to flow outwards, and possibly
to disappear altogether; whereas, without this
clearance, the thought of necessity returns to its
source, gathering in volume with each recoil.</p>
<p>But speech is frequently not at all easy, and
that not only because there is often a difficulty in
finding the right confidant, but because, with the
channels thus clogged, it is a distinct effort to clear
them. Also, though subconsciously you may
realize its desirability, it is often merely subconsciously,
and reason and common sense,&mdash;or,
rather, what you at the moment quite erroneously
believe to be reason and common sense&mdash;will urge
a hundred motives upon you in favour of silence.
Maybe that most subtle person the devil is the
suggester of these motives. If he can&#8217;t get much
of a look in by direct means, he&#8217;ll try indirect ones,
and depression is one of his favourite indirect
methods. At all events so the old spiritual writers
tell us, and doubtless they knew what they were
talking about.</p>
<p>Now, Trix was perfectly well aware that Pia
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
had something on her mind; she was also perfectly
well aware that it was something she would have
an enormous difficulty in talking about. And the
question was, how to give her even the tiniest lead.</p>
<p>Trix had stated that she had guessed the colour
of the soap-bubble; but she hadn&#8217;t the faintest
notion where it had come into existence, nor where
and how it had burst. Nor had Pia given her
directly the smallest hint of its having ever existed.
All of which facts made it exceedingly difficult
for her even to hint at soap-bubbles&mdash;figuratively
speaking of course&mdash;as a subject of conversation.</p>
<p>And Pia was slightly irritable too. Of course
it was entirely because she was unhappy, but it
didn&#8217;t conduce to intimate conversation. Prickles
would suddenly appear among the most innocent
looking of flowers, in a way that was entirely
disconcerting and utterly unpleasant. And the
worst of it was, that there was no avoiding them.
They darted out and pricked you before you were
even aware of their presence. It was so utterly
unlike Pia too, and so&mdash;Trix winked back a tear
as she thought of it&mdash;so hurting.</p>
<p>At last she came to a decision. The prickles
simply must be handled and extracted if possible.
Of course she might get quite unpleasantly stabbed
in the process, but at all events she&#8217;d be prepared
for the risk, and anything would be better than
the little darts appearing at quite unexpected
moments and places.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next time I&#8217;m pricked,&#8221; said Trix to herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
firmly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll seize hold of the prickle, and then
perhaps we&#8217;ll see where we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, as a result perhaps of this resolution, the
prickles suddenly disappeared. Trix was immeasurably
relieved in one sense, but not entirely
easy. She fancied the prickles to be hidden
rather than extracted. However, they&#8217;d ceased
to wound for the time being, and that certainly was
an enormous comfort. Miss Tibbutt, with greater
optimism than Trix, believed all to be entirely well
once more, and rejoiced accordingly.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Doctor Hilary has been over here rather
often lately,&#8221; remarked Miss Tibbutt one afternoon.
Pia and she were sitting in the garden
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Mrs. Mosely is ill,&#8221; returned Pia smiling
oracularly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But only a very little ill,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt
reflectively. &#8220;Her daughter told me only yesterday&mdash;I&#8217;m
afraid it wasn&#8217;t very grateful of her&mdash;that
the Doctor had been &#8217;moidering around like
&#8217;sif mother was on her dying bed, and her wi&#8217;
naught but a bit o&#8217; cold to her chest, what&#8217;s gone
to her head now, and a glass or two o&#8217; hot cider,
and ginger, and allspice, and rosemary will be
puttin&#8217; right sooner nor you can flick a fly off a
sugar basin.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Pia laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Tibby, he doesn&#8217;t come to see Mrs.
Mosely.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt looked up in perplexed query.</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes on here to tea, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; asked
Pia, kindly, after the manner of one giving a lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; returned Miss Tibbutt, still perplexed.
&#8220;He would naturally do so, since he is in
Woodleigh just at tea time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pia leant back in her seat, and looked at Miss
Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tibby dear, you&#8217;re amazingly slow at the
uptake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt blinked at Pia over her spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please explain,&#8221; said she meekly.</p>
<p>Pia laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you discovered, Tibby dear, that it&#8217;s
Trix he comes to see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trix!&#8221; ejaculated Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and she is quite as unaware of the fact
as you are, so don&#8217;t, for all the world, enlighten
her. Leave that to him, if he means to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt had let her work fall, and was
gazing round-eyed at Pia.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear Pia, he&#8217;s years older than Trix.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not so very many,&#8221; said Pia reassuringly.
&#8220;Fifteen or sixteen, perhaps. Trix is twenty-four,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Trix is leaving here the day after to-morrow,&#8221;
said Miss Tibbutt regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;London isn&#8217;t the antipodes,&#8221; declared Pia.
&#8220;She can come here again, or business may take
Doctor Hilary to London. There are trains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>Trix appeared at the open drawing-room window
and came out on to the terrace. She paused for a
moment to pick a dead rose off a bush growing near
the house. Then she saw the two under the lime
tree. She came towards them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Hilary has just driven up through the
plantation gate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I suppose he&#8217;s coming
to tea. His man was evidently going to put up
the horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa glanced at a gold bracelet watch
on her wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s four o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He takes tea quite for granted,&#8221; smiled Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; responded the Duchessa, &#8220;that he
considers five almost consecutive invitations equivalent
to one standing one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow I should,&#8221; nodded Trix. &#8220;What
are you looking so wise about, Tibby angel?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt started. &#8220;Was I looking wise?
I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix perched herself on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dale will clear me off in a minute,&#8221; she
announced. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll have tea out here
as usual. Till then it&#8217;s the nicest seat. Oh dear,
I wish I wasn&#8217;t going home to-morrow. That&#8217;s not
a hint to you to ask me to stay longer. I shouldn&#8217;t
hint, I&#8217;d speak straight out. But I must join
Aunt Lilla at her hydro place. She&#8217;s getting
lonely. She wants an audience to which to relate
her partner&#8217;s idiocy at Bridge, and someone to
help carry her photographic apparatus. Also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
someone to whom she can keep up a perpetual
flow of conversation. That&#8217;s not the least uncharitable,
as you&#8217;d know if you knew Aunt Lilla.
I think she must have been born talking. But I
love her all the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix tilted back her head and looked up at the
sky through the branches of the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why space is blue,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
why it&#8217;s so much bluer some days than others,
even when there aren&#8217;t any clouds.&#8221;</p>
<p>A step on the terrace behind her put an end to
her wondering. Doctor Hilary came round the
corner of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken your invitation for granted, Duchessa,
as I happened to be out this way,&#8221; said he as
he shook hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is old Mrs. Mosely still so ill?&#8221; asked Trix,
sympathy in her voice.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt kept her eyes almost guiltily on
her knitting. Pia, glancing at her, laughed inwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s better to-day,&#8221; responded Doctor Hilary
cheerfully. And then he sat down. Trix
had descended from the table, and seated herself
in a basket chair.</p>
<p>Dale brought out the tea in a few minutes, and
put it on the table Trix had vacated. The conversation
was trivial and desultory, even more
trivial and desultory than most tea-time conversation.
Miss Tibbutt was too occupied with Pia&#8217;s
recent revelation to have much thought for speech,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
Doctor Hilary was never a man of many words, the
Duchessa had been marvellously lacking in conversation
of late, and Trix&#8217;s occasional remarks
were mainly outspoken reflections on the sunshine
and the flowers, which required no particular
response. Nevertheless she was conscious of a
certain flatness in her companions, and wondered
vaguely what had caused it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Llandrindod Wells to-morrow,&#8221;
said she presently.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your visit here has come to an end?&#8221; he
queried.</p>
<p>Trix nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas, yes,&#8221; she sighed, regret, half genuine,
half mocking, in her voice. &#8220;But most certainly
I shall come down again if the Duchessa will let me
come. I had forgotten, absolutely forgotten, what
a perfectly heavenly place this was. And that
doesn&#8217;t in the least mean that I am coming solely
for the place, and not to see her, though I am aware
it did not sound entirely tactful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when do you suppose you will be coming
again?&#8221; asked Doctor Hilary with a fine assumption
of carelessness, not in the least lost upon the
Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Christmas I hope,&#8221; replied she in
Trix&#8217;s stead. &#8220;Or, indeed, at any time or moment
she chooses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary looked thoughtful, grave. A
little frown wrinkled between his eyebrows. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
pulled silently at his pipe. The Duchessa was
watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas, poor man!&#8221; thought she whimsically.
&#8220;He was about to seize opportunity, and behold,
fate snatches opportunity from him. Oh, cruel
fate!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then she beheld his brow clearing. He
knocked the ashes from his pipe, and began feeling
in his pocket for his pouch to refill it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s relieved,&#8221; declared the Duchessa inwardly,
and somewhat astounded. &#8220;He&#8217;s so amazingly
diffident, and yet so utterly in love, he&#8217;s
relieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course she was right, she knew perfectly
well she was right. Well, perhaps courage would
grow with Trix&#8217;s absence. For his own sake it was
to be devoutly trusted that it would.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary took his tobacco pouch from his
pocket, and with it a small piece of paper. He
looked at the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;The name of a new rose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Michael
Field, the new under-gardener at the Hall, gave it
to me. He tells me it is a very free flowerer, and has
a lovely scent. Do you care to have the name,
Duchessa?&#8221; He held the slip of paper towards
her.</p>
<p>The Duchessa looked carelessly at it. Trix was
looking at the Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;We have
plenty of roses here, and Thornby can no doubt
give me the name of any new kinds I shall want.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Now it was not merely an entirely unnecessary
refusal, but the tone of the speech was nearly, if
not quite, deliberately rude. It was a terribly
big prickle, and showed itself perfectly distinctly.
There wasn&#8217;t even the smallest semblance of disguise
about it.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary put the paper and his tobacco
pouch back into his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be off,&#8221; he said in an oddly quiet voice.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve one or two other calls to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt walked towards the house with
him,&mdash;to fetch some more knitting, so she announced.
Trix suspected a little mental stroking.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Pia?&#8221; asked Trix calmly,
leaning back in her chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;The matter?&#8221; said Pia, the faintest suspicion
of a flush in her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were very&mdash;very <i>snubbing</i> to Doctor Hilary,&#8221;
announced Trix, still calmly. Inwardly
she was not so calm. In fact, her heart was
thumping quite loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Trix,&#8221; replied the Duchessa coldly,
&#8220;I have an excellent gardener. I do not care for
recommendations emanating from a complete
stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no smallest need to snub Doctor
Hilary, though,&#8221; said Trix quietly. The queer
surprise on his face had caused a little stab at her
heart.</p>
<p>The Duchessa made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pia, what <i>is</i> the matter?&#8221; asked Trix again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have told you, nothing,&#8221; responded the
Duchessa.</p>
<p>Trix shook her head. &#8220;Yes; there is. You&#8217;re
unhappy. You&#8217;ve been&mdash;you can tell me to mind
my own business, if you like&mdash;you&#8217;ve been horribly
prickly lately. You&#8217;ve tried to hurt my feelings,
and Tibby&#8217;s, and now you&#8217;ve tried to hurt Doctor
Hilary&#8217;s. And he didn&#8217;t deserve it in the least, but
he thought, for a moment, he did. And it isn&#8217;t
like you, Pia. It isn&#8217;t one bit. Do tell me what&#8217;s
the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Pia again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling, that&#8217;s a&mdash;a white lie at all events.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pia coloured. &#8220;Anyhow it&#8217;s not worth talking
about,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it isn&#8217;t?&#8221; urged Trix. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
I help the weeniest bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; said Trix again, and she slipped her
arm through Pia&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all one big bruise,&#8221; said Pia suddenly.</p>
<p>Trix stroked her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is entirely foolish of me to care,&#8221; said the
Duchessa slowly. &#8220;But I happen to have trusted
someone rather implicitly. I never dreamed it
possible the person could stoop to act a lie. I
would not have minded the thing itself,&mdash;it would
have been absurd for me to have done so. But it
hurt rather considerably that the person should
have deceived me in the matter, in fact have acted
a deliberate lie about it. I am honestly doing my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
best to forget the whole thing, but I am being
constantly reminded of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix sat up very straight. So that was it,
she told herself. How idiotic of her not to have
guessed at once,&mdash;days ago, that is,&mdash;when she
herself had made her marvellous discovery. It
was now quite plain to her mind that Pia must
have made it too. It was Doctor Hilary whom
she believed to be the fraud, the friend whom she
had trusted, and who had acted a lie. The whole
oddness of Pia&#8217;s behaviour became suddenly
perfectly clear to her. Tibby had told her that it
had begun on her return to Woodleigh. Well,
that must have been when she first found out.
How she&#8217;d found out, Trix didn&#8217;t know. But that
was beside the mark. She evidently had found out.</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s mind ran back over various little incidents.
She remembered the snub administered to Father
Dormer the evening after her arrival. The new
under-gardener had been the subject of conversation
then, of course reminding Pia of the Hall.
And she had snubbed Father Dormer, as she had
snubbed Doctor Hilary a few minutes ago. All
Pia&#8217;s snubs and sudden prickles came back to her
mind. They all had their origin in some inadvertent
remark regarding the Hall.</p>
<p>Yes; everything was as clear as daylight now.
Pia had learnt of this business in some roundabout
way that did not allow of her speaking openly to
Doctor Hilary on the subject, so she saw merely
the fraud, and had no idea that it was, in all probability,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
an entirely justifiable one, and that at all
events no one had told any deliberate lie. Of
course Pia was disturbed and upset. Wouldn&#8217;t
she have been herself, in Pia&#8217;s place? And hadn&#8217;t
she felt quite unreasonably unhappy till Mr.
Danver had assured her that Doctor Hilary had
not spoken a single word of actual untruth?</p>
<p>Oh, poor Pia!</p>
<p>Now, it was not in the least astonishing that
Trix&#8217;s mind should have leapt to this entirely
erroneous conclusion. For the last fortnight it
had been full of her discovery. The smallest thing
that seemed to bear on it, instantly appeared
actually to do so. And everything in her present
train of thought fitted in with astonishing accuracy.
Each little incident in Pia&#8217;s late behaviour fell into
place with it.</p>
<p>She did not stop to consider that, if this were the
sole cause of Pia&#8217;s trouble, she&mdash;Pia&mdash;was unquestionably
taking a very exaggerated view of it.
It never occurred to Trix to do so. If she had considered
the matter at all, it would have been merely
to realize that Pia&#8217;s attitude towards it was remarkably
like what her own would have been. She
would have known, had she attempted analysis
of the subject, that she herself was frequently
troubled about trifles, or what at any rate would
have appeared to others as trifles, where any friend
of hers was concerned. Her friends&#8217; actions and
her own, in what are ordinarily termed little
things, mattered quite supremely to her, most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
particularly in any question regarding honour.
The smallest infringement of it would be enough
to cause her sleepless nights and anxious days.
Therefore, without attempting any analysis, she
could perfectly well understand what she believed
Pia&#8217;s point of view to be. And her present
distress was, that, in view of her promise, she
could do nothing definite to help her.</p>
<p>She could not show her Doctor Hilary&#8217;s standpoint
in the matter, since it was not permissible for
her to give the smallest hint that she was acquainted
either with it, or with the whole business
at all. She could not even hint that she believed
Doctor Hilary to be the person concerning whom
Pia was troubled. She could only take refuge in
generalities, which, with a definite case before her,
she felt to be a peculiarly unsatisfactory proceeding.
Yet there was nothing else to be done. It was
more than probable that Pia was in the same kind
of cleft stick as herself, and that therefore direct
discussion of the matter was out of the question.</p>
<p>Still stroking Pia&#8217;s hand, Trix spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pia, darling, what I am going to say will sound
very poor comfort, I know. But it&#8217;s this. Isn&#8217;t it
just possible that you could give the&mdash;the person
concerned the benefit of a doubt? Even if it
seems to you that he has acted a lie, and therefore
been something of a fraud, mayn&#8217;t there be some
extraordinarily good reason, behind it all, that circumstances
are preventing him from explaining?
Such queer things do happen, and sometimes people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
have to appear to others as frauds, when they
really aren&#8217;t a bit. If you were ever really friends
with the person&mdash;and you must have been, or you
wouldn&#8217;t care&mdash;I&#8217;d just say to myself that I would
trust him in spite of every appearance to the
contrary. Perhaps some day you&#8217;ll be most awfully
sorry if you don&#8217;t. And isn&#8217;t it a million
times better to be even mistaken in trust where a
friend is concerned, than give way to the smallest
doubt which may afterwards be proved to be a
wrong doubt?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pia was silent. Then she said in an oddly
even voice,</p>
<p>&#8220;Trix do you <i>know</i> anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix flushed to the roots of her hair. Pia
turned to look at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trix!&#8221; she said amazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pia,&#8221; implored Trix, &#8220;you mustn&#8217;t ask me a
single question, because I can&#8217;t answer you. But
do, do, trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pia drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trix, you&#8217;re the uncanniest little mortal
that ever lived, and I can&#8217;t imagine how you could
have guessed, or what exactly it is you really do
know. But I believe I am going to take your
advice.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>AN OFFER AND A REFUSAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Antony was working in his front garden. It
was a Saturday afternoon, and a blazingly hot one.
Every now and then he paused to lean on his spade,
and look out to where the blue sea lay shining and
glistening in the sunlight.</p>
<p>It was amazingly blue, almost as blue as the
sea depicted on the posters of famous seaside
resorts, posters in which a bare-legged child with a
bucket and spade, and the widest of wide smiles
is invariably seen in the foreground. Certainly
the designers of these posters are not students of
child nature. If they were, they would know that
a really absorbed and happy child is almost
portentously solemn. It hasn&#8217;t the time to waste
on smiles; the building of sand castles and fortresses
is infinitely too engrossing an occupation. A
smile will greet the anticipation; it is lost in the
stupendous joy of the fact. But as smiles are
evidently considered <i>de rigueur</i> by the designers of
posters, and as the mere anticipation will not
allow of the portrayal of the Rickett&#8217;s blue sea,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
destined to hit the eye of the beholder, smiles and
sea have&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;to be combined.</p>
<p>Antony gazed at the sea, if not quite as blue
as a poster sea, yet&mdash;as already stated&mdash;amazingly
blue. Josephus lay on a bit of hot earth watching
him, his nose between his forepaws, and quite
exhausted after a mad and wholly objectless ten
minutes&#8217; race round the garden.</p>
<p>Antony turned from his contemplation of the
sea, and once more grasped his spade. Presently
he turned up a small flat round object, which at
first sight he took to be a penny. He picked it up,
and rubbed the dirt off it. It proved to be merely
a small lead disk, utterly useless and valueless;
he didn&#8217;t even know what it could have been used
for. He threw it on the earth again, and went on
with his digging. But it, or his action of tossing it
on to the earth, had started a train of thought. It
is extraordinary what trifles will serve to start a
lengthy and connected train of thought. Sometimes
it is quite interesting, arriving at a certain
point, to trace one&#8217;s imaginings backwards, and
see from whence they started.</p>
<p>The disk reminded Antony of the coppers he had
tossed to the child at Teneriffe. From it he quite
unconsciously found himself reviewing all the
subsequent happenings. They linked on one to
the other without a break. He hardly knew he
was reviewing them, though they so absorbed his
mind that he was totally unconscious of his surroundings,
and even of the fact that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
digging. His employment had become quite mechanical.</p>
<p>He was so engrossed that he did not hear a step
in the road behind him. Josephus heard it, however,
and gave vent to a faint whine, raising his
head from between his paws. The sound roused
Antony, and he turned.</p>
<p>His face went suddenly white beneath its
bronze. The Duchessa di Donatello was standing
at the gate, looking over into the garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I come in and rest a moment?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;The sun is so hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony could hardly believe his ears. Surely
he could not have heard aright? But there she
was, standing at the gate, most evidently waiting
his permission to enter.</p>
<p>He left his spade sticking in the earth, and
went to unfasten the gate. Without speaking,
he led the way up the little flagged path, and into
the parlour.</p>
<p>The Duchessa crossed to the oak settle and sat
down. Slowly she began to pull off her long
crinkly doe-skin gloves. Antony watched her.
He saw the gleam of a diamond ring on her hand.
It was a ring he had often noticed. A picture of
the Duchessa sitting at a little round table among
orange trees in green tubs flashed suddenly and
very vividly into his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very hot,&#8221; said the Duchessa looking
up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Antony mechanically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Am I interrupting your work?&#8221; asked the
Duchessa.</p>
<p>Antony started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he replied. And he sat down by the
table, leaning slightly forward with his arms upon
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind my coming here?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Antony reflectively.</p>
<p>A gleam of a smile flashed across the Duchessa&#8217;s
face. The reply was so Antonian.</p>
<p>There was quite a long silence. Suddenly
Antony roused himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let me get you some tea, Madam,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>Awaiting no reply, he went into the little
scullery, where the fire by which he had cooked his
midday meal was still alight. The kettle filled
with water and placed on the stove, he stood
by it, in a measure wishful, yet oddly reluctant
to return to the parlour. Reluctance won the
day. He remained by the kettle, gazing at it.</p>
<p>Left alone, the Duchessa looked round the
parlour. It was exceedingly primitive, yet, to her
mind, curiously interesting. Of course in reality it
was not unlike dozens of other cottage parlours, but
it held a personality of its own for her. It was the
room where Antony Gray lived.</p>
<p>She pictured him at his lonely meals, sitting at
the table where he had sat a moment or so agone;
sitting on the settle where she was now sitting,
certainly smoking, and possibly reading. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
found herself wondering what he thought about.
Did he ever think of the <i>Fort Salisbury</i>, she
wondered? Or had he blotted it from his mind,
as she had endeavoured&mdash;ineffectually&mdash;to do?
And then, with that thought, with the possibility
that he had done so, her presence in the room
seemed quite suddenly an intrusion. What on
earth would he think of her for coming? And
what on earth did she mean to say to him now she
had come?</p>
<p>The impulse which had led her down the lane,
which had caused her to pause at the gate and
speak to him, all at once seemed to her perfectly
idiotic, and, worse still, intrusive and impertinent.
What possible excuse was she going to give for it,
in the face of her behaviour to him that afternoon
on the moorland? Merely to have asked for shelter
on account of the heat, appeared to her now as the
flimsiest of excuses, and would appear to him
as an excuse simply to pry upon him, to see his
mode of living. He had not returned to the parlour.
Doubtless his absence was a silent rebuke to
her. She had thrust the necessity of hospitality
upon him, but he intended to show her plainly
that it was entirely of necessity he had offered it.</p>
<p>Her cheeks burned at the thought. She looked
quickly round. Anyhow there was still time for
flight. She picked up her gloves from where she
had laid them on the settle, and got to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The water won&#8217;t be long in boiling, Madam,&#8221;
said Antony&#8217;s voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>He had come back quietly into the room. For
a moment he glanced in half surprise to see the
Duchessa standing by the settle. Then he
crossed to the dresser, and began taking down a
cup, a saucer, and a plate.</p>
<p>The Duchessa sat down again, drawing her hand
nervously along her gloves.</p>
<p>She looked at him getting down the things and
setting them on the table. She watched his neat,
deft movements. Antony took no notice of her;
she might have been part of the settle itself for
all the attention he paid her. His preparations
made, he returned momentarily to the scullery to
fill the teapot. Coming back with it he placed it
on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is ready, Madam,&#8221; he said. Dale
himself could not have been more distantly
respectful.</p>
<p>The Duchessa looked at the one cup, the one
saucer, and the one plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to have some tea, too?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Servants do not sit down with their superiors,&#8221;
said Antony.</p>
<p>The colour rose hotly in the Duchessa&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>Antony lifted his shoulders, the merest suspicion
of a shrug.</p>
<p>&#8220;I merely state a fact,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you to,&#8221; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a command?&#8221; asked Antony.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you like to take it so,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>Antony turned to the dresser. He took down
another cup and plate and put them on the table.
Then he stood by it, waiting for her to be seated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sugar?&#8221; asked the Duchessa. She was making
a brave endeavour to steady the trembling of
her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, Madam,&#8221; said Antony gravely.</p>
<p>The meal proceeded in dead silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gray,&#8221; said the Duchessa suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; said Antony respectfully, &#8220;is
Michael Field.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa gave a little shaky laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Michael Field,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was not
very kind that day I met you on the moorland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony kept his eyes fixed on his plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no reason that you should be kind,&#8221;
he replied quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was,&#8221; flashed the Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; replied Antony, calmly. &#8220;Ladies
in your position are under no obligation to
be kind to servants, except to those of their own
household. Even then, it is more or less of a
condescension on their part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not always a servant,&#8221; said the
Duchessa.</p>
<p>There was the fraction of a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not happen to be actually in a situation
when I was on the <i>Fort Salisbury</i>, if that is what
you mean, Madam,&#8221; returned Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean more than that,&#8221; retorted the Duchessa.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
&#8220;I mean that by your up-bringing you are
not a servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I happen to have had a better education than
falls to the lot of most men who have been in the
positions I have been in, and who are in positions
like my present one. But most assuredly I am
a servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What positions have you been in?&#8221; demanded
the Duchessa.</p>
<p>A very faint smile showed itself on Antony&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a sort of miner&#8217;s boy,&#8221; he replied
slowly. &#8220;I have been a farm hand, mainly used
for cleaning out pigsties, and that kind of work.
I have been servant in a gambling saloon; odd man
on a cattle boat. I have worked on a farm again.
And now I am an under-gardener. Very assuredly
I have been, and am, a servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa&#8217;s brows wrinkled. &#8220;Yet you
speak like a gentleman, and&mdash;and you wore dress
clothes as if you were used to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again a faint smile showed itself on Antony&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I happen to have had a decent
education in my youth. Also, I would suggest,
that even butlers and waiters wear dress clothes as
if they were used to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more there was a silence. A rather long
silence this time. It was broken by the Duchessa&#8217;s
voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some months ago,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I offered my
friendship to Antony Gray; I now offer that same
friendship to Michael Field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony gave a little laugh. There was an odd
gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Field regrets that he must decline
the honour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duchessa&#8217;s face went dead white.</p>
<p>Antony got to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t misunderstand me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I fully appreciate the honour you have done me,
but&mdash;&#8221; he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;&#8220;it is quite
impossible to accept it. It&mdash;you must see that for
yourself&mdash;would be a rather ridiculous situation.
The Duchessa di Donatello and a friendship with
an under-gardener! I don&#8217;t fancy either of us
would care to be made a mock of, even by the
extremely small world in which we happen to live.&#8221;
He stopped.</p>
<p>The Duchessa rose too. Her eyes were steely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for reminding me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In
a moment of absurd impulsiveness I had overlooked
that fact. Also, thank you for&mdash;for your
hospitality.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved to the door without looking at him.
Antony was before her, and had it open. He
followed her down the path and unfastened the
wicket gate. She passed through it without turning
her head, and walked rather deliberately down
the lane.</p>
<p>Antony went back into the cottage. For a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
moment he stood looking at the table, his throat
contracted. Then slowly, and with oddly unseeing
eyes, he began clearing away the débris of the
meal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>LETTERS AND MRS. ARBUTHNOT</h3>
</div>

<p>Trix was sitting in a summer-house in the
garden of an hotel at Llandrindod Wells. She
was reading a letter, a not altogether satisfactory
letter to judge by the wrinkling of her brows,
and the gravity of her eyes.</p>
<p>The letter was from the Duchessa di Donatello,
and ran as follows:</p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Trix</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you had a comfortable journey, and
that Mrs. Arbuthnot had not been pining for
you too deeply. It is a pity her letters gave you
the impression that she was feeling your absence
so acutely. Possibly it is always wiser to subtract
at least half of the impression conveyed in
both written and spoken words. Please understand
that I am speaking in generalities when I
say that we are exceedingly apt to exaggerate our
own importance to others, and their importance
to us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking of exaggeration, will you forget our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
conversation on your last evening here? I exaggerated
my own trouble and its cause. Rather
foolishly I let your remarks influence me, and
sought an explanation, or rather, attempted to
ignore appearances, and return to the old footing.
The result being that not only did I find that there
was no explanation to be given, but that I got rather
badly snubbed. As you, of course, will know who
administered the snub, you can understand that it
was peculiarly unpleasant. I had endeavoured to
ignore the fact that he was my social inferior, but
he reminded me of it in a way it was impossible to
overlook, and showed me that he deeply resented
what he evidently looked upon as a somewhat
impertinent condescension on my part.</p>
<p>&#8220;The theories, my dear Trix, which you set forth
in the moonlight under the lime trees, simply won&#8217;t
hold water. For your own sake I advise you to
abandon them forthwith. Blood will always tell;
and sooner or later, if we attempt intimacy with
those not of our own station in life, we shall get a
glimpse of the hairy hoof. I know the theories
sound all right, and quite beautifully Christian&mdash;as
set forth in the moonlight,&mdash;but they don&#8217;t
work in this twentieth century, as I have found to
my cost. You had better make up your mind
to that fact before you, too, get a slap in the face.
I assure you you don&#8217;t feel like turning the other
cheek. However, that will do. But as it was
mainly through following out your theories and
advice that I found my pride not only in the mud,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
but rubbed rather heavily in it, I thought you
might as well have a word of warning. Please
now consider the matter closed, and never make
the smallest reference to that rather idiotic conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Hilary was over here again yesterday.
He enquired after you, and asked to be very
kindly remembered to you. I should like Doctor
Hilary to attend me in any illness. He gives one
such a feeling of strength and reliance. There&#8217;s
absolutely no humbug about him.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:6em;'>&#8220;Much love, my dear Trix,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Pia Di Donatello.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trix read the letter through very carefully, and
then dropped it on her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t Doctor Hilary!&#8221; she ejaculated.
&#8220;So who on earth was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat gazing through the opening of the
summer-house towards the garden. It was the
oddest <i>puzzle</i> she had ever encountered. Who on
earth could it have been? And why&mdash;since it
wasn&#8217;t Doctor Hilary&mdash;had Pia jumped to the
conclusion that she&mdash;Trix&mdash;knew who it was?</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t Mr. Danver, that was very certain.
&#8220;Social inferior&#8221; put that fact out of the question.
But then, what social inferior had been mixed up
in the business? Or&mdash;Trix&#8217;s brain leapt from
point to point&mdash;had Pia&#8217;s trouble nothing whatever
to do with the mad business at the Hall? Had she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
and Pia simply been playing a quite amazing game
of cross-purposes that evening? It would seem
that must have been the case. Yet the recognition
of that fact didn&#8217;t bring her in the smallest
degree nearer the solution of the riddle. Again,
who on earth was it? What social inferior was
there, could there possibly be, at Woodleigh, to
cause Pia a moment&#8217;s trouble? Every preconceived
notion on Trix&#8217;s part, including the colour
of the soap-bubble, vanished into thin air, and left
her contemplating an inexplicable mystery.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, it had affected Pia pretty
deeply. It was absurd for her to say the incident
was closed. Externally it might be, in the matter
of not referring to it again. Interiorly it had left
a wound, and one which was very far from being
easily healed, to judge by Pia&#8217;s letter. It had not
been written by Pia at all, but by a very bitter
woman, who had merely a superficial likeness to
Pia. That fact, and that fact alone, caused Trix
to imagine that she had been right when she told
Tibby&mdash;if not in so many words, at least virtually
speaking&mdash;that love had come into Pia&#8217;s life.
Love embittered alone could have inflicted the
wound she felt Pia to be enduring. And yet the
wording of her letter would appear to put that
surmise out of the question. Truly it was an
insolvable riddle.</p>
<p>Once more she re-read the letter, but it didn&#8217;t
help her in the smallest degree. There was only
one small ounce of comfort in it. It wasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Doctor Hilary who had caused the wound. Pia
had merely tried to pick a quarrel with him, as she
had frequently tried to pick one with herself and
Tibby, because she was unhappy. If only Trix
knew what had caused the unhappiness. And
Pia thought she did know. If she wrote and told
her now that she hadn&#8217;t the smallest conception of
what she was talking about, it would in all probability
rouse conjectures in Pia&#8217;s mind as to what
Trix <i>had</i> thought. That, having in view her
promise, had certainly better be avoided.</p>
<p>Should she, then, ignore Pia&#8217;s letter, or should
she reply to it? She weighed the pros and cons
of this question for the next ten minutes, and
finally decided she would write, and at once.</p>
<p>Returning, therefore, to the hotel, she indited
the following brief missive:</p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My dear Pia,</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The incident is closed so far as I am concerned.
But I don&#8217;t mean to give up seeking my pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow. I dare say most people
would call it an imaginary quest. Well then, I like
an imaginary quest. It helps to make me forget
much that is prosaic, and a good deal that is sordid
in this work-a-day world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please remember me to Doctor Hilary when
you see him. Best love, Pia darling,</p>

<p>After which there was a cessation of correspondence
for a time, neither having anything further to
say on the subject, or at all events, nothing further
they felt disposed to set down in writing.</p>
<p>Trix spent her mornings, and the afternoons,
till tea time, in her Aunt&#8217;s company. After that,
Mrs. Arbuthnot being engrossed in Bridge till
bedtime, Trix was free to do exactly as she liked.
What she liked was walking till it was time to
dress for dinner, and spending the evenings in the
garden.</p>
<p>Even before her father&#8217;s death, Trix had stayed
frequently with her aunt. Her mother had
died when Trix was three years old and Mrs.
Arbuthnot, a widow with no children of her own,
would have been quite ready to adopt Trix. But
neither Mr. Devereux, nor, for that matter, Trix
herself, were in the least disposed to fall in with
her plans. Trix was merely lent to her for fairly
lengthy periods, and it had been during one of
these periods that Mrs. Arbuthnot had taken her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
to a farm near Byestry, in which place Mr. Devereux
had spent most of his early years.</p>
<p>In those days Mrs. Arbuthnot&#8217;s one hobby had
been photography. People used to say, of course
unjustly, that she never beheld any view with the
naked eye, but merely in the reflector of a photographic
apparatus. Yet it is entirely obvious
that she must first have regarded it in the ordinary
way to judge of its photographic merits. Anyhow
it is true that quite a good deal of her time was
spent beneath the folds of a black cloth (she never
condescended to anything so amateurish as a mere
kodak), or in the seclusion of a dark room.</p>
<p>Veritable dark rooms being seldom procurable
on her travels, she invariably carried with her two
or three curtains of thick red serge, several rolls of
brown paper, and a bottle of stickphast. The two
last mentioned were employed for covering chinks
in doors, etc. It cannot be said that it was entirely
beneficial to the doors, but hotel proprietors and
landladies seldom made any complaint after the
first remonstrance, as Mrs. Arbuthnot was always
ready to make handsome compensation for any
damage caused. It is to be feared that at times
her generosity was largely imposed upon.</p>
<p>In addition to the red curtains, the brown paper,
and the stickphast, two large boxes were included
in her luggage, one containing all her photographic
necessaries, and they were not few, the other
containing several dozen albums of prints.</p>
<p>Of late years Bridge had taken quite as large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
a place in her affections as photography. Not that
she felt any rivalry between the two; her pleasure
in both pastimes was quite equally balanced. Her
mornings and early afternoons were given to photography.
The late afternoons and evenings Mrs.
Arbuthnot devoted to Bridge.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>One exceedingly wet afternoon, tea being recently
concluded, Trix in her bedroom was surveying
the weather from the window.</p>
<p>She was debating within her mind whether to
don mackintosh and souwester and face the elements,
or whether to retire to a far corner of the
drawing-room with a novel, as much as possible
out of earshot of the Bridge players. She was
still in two minds as to which prospect most
appealed to her mood, when Mrs. Arbuthnot
tapped on her door, and immediately after sailed
into the room. It is the only word applicable to
Mrs. Arbuthnot&#8217;s entry into any room.</p>
<p>She was a large fair woman, very distinctly
inclined to stoutness. In her youth she had been
both slender, and quick in her movements; but
recognizing, and rightly, that quickness means a
certain loss of dignity in the stout, she had trained
herself to be exceedingly deliberate in her actions.
There was an element of consciousness in her
deliberation, therefore, which gave the impression
of a rather large sailing vessel under weigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trix, dearest,&#8221; she began. And then she perceived
that Trix had been observing the weather.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You were not going out, were you, dearest? I
really think it would hardly be wise. It is blowing
quite furiously. I know it is rather dull for you as
you don&#8217;t play Bridge. Such a pity, too, as you
understand it so well. But I have a suggestion
to make. Will you paste some of my newest
prints into the latest album? There is a table in
the window in my room, and a fresh bottle of stickphast.
Not in the window, I don&#8217;t mean that,
but in my trunk. And Maunder can find it for
you.&#8221; Maunder was Mrs. Arbuthnot&#8217;s maid.</p>
<p>Trix turned from the window. Of course Mrs.
Arbuthnot&#8217;s request settled the question of a walk.
She had really been in two minds about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Where are the
prints?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot brightened visibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re inside a green envelope on the writing-table.
You&#8217;ll find a small pair of very sharp scissors
there too. The dark edges are so unsightly if
not trimmed. You&#8217;re sure you don&#8217;t mind, dearest?
It really will be quite a pleasant occupation.
It is so dreadfully wet. And Maunder will give
you the stickphast. There is clean blotting-paper
on the writing-table too, and Maunder can find
you anything else you want. Well, that&#8217;s all
right. Maunder is in my room now. She will be
going to her tea in ten minutes, so perhaps you
might go to her at once. And she is sure to be
downstairs for at least an hour and a half, if not
longer. Servants always have so much to talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
about, and take so long saying it. Why, I can&#8217;t
imagine. It always seems to me so much better
not to waste words unnecessarily. So you will
have the room to yourself, till she comes to put out
my evening things. And I must go back to the
drawing-room at once, or they will be waiting
Bridge for me. And Lady Fortescue hates being
kept waiting. It puts her in a bad temper, and
when she&#8217;s in a bad temper she is extraordinarily
erratic as to her declarations. Though, for that
matter, she is seldom anything else. I don&#8217;t
mean bad-tempered, but seldom anything but
erratic. So, dearest, I mustn&#8217;t let you keep me
any longer. Don&#8217;t forget to ask Maunder for
the stickphast, and anything else you want. And
the prints and the scissors&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; nodded Trix cheerfully, &#8220;on the
writing table. Hurry, Aunt Lilla, or they&#8217;ll all be
swearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dearest, I trust not. Though perhaps
interiorly. And even that is a sin. I remember&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix propelled her gently but firmly from the
room. Doubtless Mrs. Arbuthnot continued her
remembrances &#8220;interiorly&#8221; as she went down the
passage and descended the stairs.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Trix, provided with the
stickphast, the green envelope, the scissors, and the
clean blotting-paper, and having a very large
album spread open before her on a table, was
busily engaged with the prints. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
mainly views of Llandrindod Wells, though there
were quite a good many groups among them, as
well as a fair number of single figures. Trix
herself appeared chiefly in these last,&mdash;Trix in a
hat, Trix without a hat, Trix smiling, serious,
standing, or sitting.</p>
<p>For half an hour or so Trix worked industriously,
indefatigably. She trimmed off dark edges,
she applied stickphast, she adjusted the prints in
careful positions, she smoothed them down neatly
with the clean blotting-paper. At the end of that
time, she paused to let the paste dry somewhat
before turning the page.</p>
<p>With a view to whiling away the interval, she
possessed herself of a sister album, one of the many
relations stacked against a wall, choosing it haphazard
from among the number.</p>
<p>There is a distinct fascination in photographs
which recall early memories. Trix fell promptly
under the spell of this fascination. The minutes
passed, finding her engrossed, absorbed. Turning
a page she came upon views of Byestry, herself&mdash;a
white-robed, short-skirted small person&mdash;appearing
in the foreground of many.</p>
<p>Trix smiled at the representations. It really
was rather an adorable small person. It was so
slim-legged, mop-haired, and elfin-smiled. It was
seen, for the most part, lavishing blandishments
on a somewhat ungainly puppy. One photograph,
however, represented the small person in company
with a boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Trix looked at this photograph, and suddenly
amazement fell full upon her. She looked, she
leant back in her chair and shut her eyes, and then
she looked again. Yes; there was no mistake, no
shadow of a mistake. The boy in the photograph
was the man with the wheelbarrow, or the other
way about, which possibly might be the more
correct method of expressing the matter. But,
whichever the method, the fact remained the
same.</p>
<p>Trix stared harder at the photograph, cogitating,
bewildered. Below it was written in Mrs.
Arbuthnot&#8217;s rather sprawling handwriting, &#8220;T. D.,
aged five. A. G., aged fourteen. Byestry, 1892.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who on earth was A. G.? Trix searched the
recesses of her mind. And then suddenly, welling
up like a bubbling spring, came memory. Why, of
course A. G. was the boy she used to play with, the
boy&mdash;she began to remember things clearly now&mdash;who
had tried to sail across the pond, and with
whom she had gone to search for pheasants&#8217; eggs.
A dozen little details came back to her mind, even
the sound of the boy&#8217;s voice, and his laugh, a curiously
infectious laugh.</p>
<p>Oh, she remembered him distinctly, vividly.
But, what&mdash;and there lay the puzzlement, the
bewilderment&mdash;was the boy, now grown to manhood,
doing with a wheelbarrow in the grounds of
Chorley Old Hall, and, moreover, dressed as a
gardener, working as a gardener, and speaking&mdash;well,
at any rate speaking after the manner of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
gardener? Perhaps to have said, speaking as
though he were on a different social footing from
Trix, would have better expressed Trix&#8217;s meaning.
But she chose her own phraseology, and doubtless
it conveyed to her exactly what she did
mean. Anyhow, it was an amazing riddle, an
insoluble riddle. Trix stared at the photograph,
finding no answer to it.</p>
<p>Finding no answer she left the book open at
the page, and returned to the sticking in of prints.
But every now and then her eyes wandered to the
big volume at the other end of the table, wonderment
and query possessing her soul.</p>
<p>Maunder appeared just as Trix had finished
her task. Helpful, business-like, she approached
the table, a gleam spelling order and tidiness in her
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave that album, please,&#8221; said Trix, seeing
the helpful Maunder about to shut and bear away
the book containing the boy&#8217;s photograph.</p>
<p>Maunder hesitated, sighed conspicuously, and
left the book, occupying herself instead with
putting away the stickphast, the scissors, the now
not as clean blotting-paper, and somewhat resignedly
picking up small shreds of paper which were
scattered upon the table-cloth and carpet. In the
midst of these occupations the dressing-gong
sounded. Maunder pricked up her ears, actually
almost, as well as figuratively.</p>
<p>Ten minutes elapsed. Then Mrs. Arbuthnot
appeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What, finished, dearest!&#8221; she exclaimed as she
opened the door. &#8220;Splendid! How quick you&#8217;ve
been. And I am sure the time flew on&mdash;not leaden
feet, but just the opposite. It always does when
one is pleasantly occupied. Developing photographs
or a rubber of Bridge, it&#8217;s just the same,
the hands of the clock spin round. And I&#8217;ve won
six shillings, and it would have been more if it
had not been for Lady Fortescue&#8217;s last declaration.
Four hearts, my dearest, and the knave as her
highest card. They doubled us, and of course
we went down. I had only two small ones. I had
shown her my own weakness by not supporting her
declaration. Of course at my first lead I led her a
heart, and it was won by the queen on my left.
A heart was returned, and Lady Fortescue played
the nine. It was covered by the ten which won the
trick. She didn&#8217;t make a single trick in her own
suit. It is quite impossible to understand Lady
Fortescue&#8217;s declarations. And did you put in all
the prints? They will have nearly filled the last
pages. I must send for another album. Are these
they?&#8221; She crossed to the open volume.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Trix, &#8220;that&#8217;s an old volume. I
was looking at it. Who&#8217;s the boy in the photograph,
Aunt Lilla?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot bent towards the page.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A. G., aged fourteen.&#8217; Let me see. Why, of
course that was Antony Gray, Richard Gray&#8217;s son.
But I never knew his father. He&mdash;I mean the
boy&mdash;was staying in rooms with his aunt, Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
Stanley. She was his father&#8217;s sister, and married
George Stanley. Something to do with the stock
exchange, and quite a wealthy man, though a bad
temper. And his wife was not a happy woman,
as you can guess. Temper means such endless
friction when it&#8217;s bad, especially with regard to
things like interfering with the servants, and wanting
to order the kitchen dinner. So absurd, as well
as annoying. There&#8217;s a place for a man and a place
for a woman, and the man&#8217;s place is not the
kitchen, even if his entry is only figurative. By
which I mean that Mr. Stanley did not actually go
to the kitchen, but gave orders from his study, on
a sort of telephone business he had had fixed up
and communicating with the kitchen. So trying
for the cook&#8217;s nerves, especially when making
omelettes, or anything that required particular
attention. She never knew when his voice
wouldn&#8217;t shout at her from the wall. A small
black thing like a hollow handle fixed close to the
kitchen range. Quite uncomfortably near her
ear. Worse than if he himself had appeared at the
kitchen door, which would have been normal,
though trying. And Mr. Stanley never lowered
his voice. He always spoke as if one were deaf,
especially to foreigners who spoke English every
bit as well as himself. Mrs. Stanley gave excellent
wages, and even bonuses out of her dress money to
try and keep cooks. But they all said the voice
from the wall got on their nerves. And no wonder.
And then unpleasantness when the cooks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
left. As if it were poor Mrs. Stanley&#8217;s fault, and
not his own. She once suggested they should give
up their house and live in an hotel. He couldn&#8217;t
have a telephone arrangement to the kitchen
there. But he was more unpleasant still. Almost
violent. And he died at last of an attack of
apoplexy. Such a relief to Mrs. Stanley. Not the
dying of apoplexy, which was a grief. But the
quiet, and the being able to keep a cook when he
had gone.&#8221; Mrs. Arbuthnot paused a moment to
take breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what became of the boy?&#8221; asked
Trix.</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot considered for an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he went abroad. Yes; I remember
now, hearing from Mrs. Stanley just before she died
herself, poor soul&mdash;ptomaine poisoning and a dirty
cook, some people seem pursued by cooks, figuratively
speaking, of course,&mdash;that her brother had
lost all his money and died, and that Antony
had gone abroad. We are told not to judge, and
I don&#8217;t, but it did seem to me that Mrs. Stanley
ought to have made him some provision, if not
before her death, at least after it. By will, of
course I mean by &#8216;after&#8217;! which in a sense would
have been before death. But you understand.
Instead of which she left all her money to a deaf
and dumb asylum. No doubt good in its way, but
not like anything religious, which would have
been more justifiable, though she was a Protestant.
And teaching dumb people to speak is always a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
doubtful blessing. They have such an odd way of
talking. Scarcely understandable. But perhaps
better than nothing for themselves, though
not for others. Though with a penniless nephew
and all that money I <i>do</i> think&mdash;But, as I said, we
are told not to judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t know what became of him after
that?&#8221; asked Trix.</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot looked almost reproachful.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dearest, how could I? Mrs. Stanley in the
family grave with her brother,&mdash;she mentioned
that particularly in her will, and not with her
husband, I suppose she could not have had much
affection for him,&mdash;I could not possibly hear any
more of the young man. There were no other
relations, and I did not even know what part
of the world he was in. Nor should I have
thought it advisable to write to him if I had,
unless it had been a brief letter of consolation as
from a much older woman, which I was. But even
with age I do not think a correspondence between
men and women desirable, unless they are related,
especially with Mrs. Barclay&#8217;s novels so widely
read. Not for my own sake, of course, as I do
not think I am easily given to absurd notions.
But one never knows what ideas a young man
may not get into his head. And now, dear child,
I must dress. Maunder has been sighing for
the last ten minutes, and I know what that
means. And you&#8217;ll be late yourself, if you don&#8217;t
go.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>Much later in the evening, Trix, in a far corner
of the drawing-room with a novel, found herself
again pondering deeply on her discovery.</p>
<p>She was absolutely and entirely certain that
the man with the wheelbarrow was none other than
Antony Gray, the boy with whom she had played
in her childhood. She remembered now that his
face had been oddly familiar to her at the time,
though, being unable to put any name to him, she
had looked upon it merely as a chance likeness.
But since he was Antony Gray, what was he doing
at Chorley Old Hall?</p>
<p>Her first impulse had been to write to the
Duchessa, tell her of her certainty, and ask her to
find out any particulars she could regarding the
man. She had abandoned that idea, in view of
the fact that she would have to say where she had
met him, which would very probably lead to
questions difficult to answer.</p>
<p>One thing she would do, however, and she gave
a little inward laugh at the thought, when she was
next at Byestry, if she saw him again, she would
ask him if he remembered the pond and the
pheasants&#8217; eggs. It would be amusing to see
his amazed face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>FOR THE DAY ALONE</h3>
</div>

<p>Probably there are times in the life of every
human being, when the only possible method of
living at all, would seem to be by living in the
day&mdash;nay, in the moment&mdash;alone, resolutely shutting
one&#8217;s eyes to the mistakes behind one, refusing
to look at the blankness ahead. And this is more
especially the case when the mistakes and the
blankness have been caused by our own actions.
There is not even stolid philosophy to come
to our aid, a shrugging of the shoulders, a foisting
of the blame on to fate. It may be that the
majority of the incidents have been forced upon us,
that we have not been free agents in the matter,
but if we must of honesty say,&mdash;Here or there was
the mistake which led to them, and I made that
mistake of my own free will,&mdash;we cannot turn to
philosophy regarding fate for our comfort.</p>
<p>To Antony&#8217;s mind he had made a big mistake.
Fate had been responsible for his receipt of that
letter, it had had nothing to do with himself; he
might even consider that, having received it, fate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
was largely responsible for his journey to England
and his meeting with the Duchessa, but he could
not possibly accuse fate of his acceptance of those
mad conditions attached to the will. He had been
an entirely free agent so far as they were concerned;
they had been put before him for him to
accept or reject them as he chose, and he had
accepted them. It had been a huge blunder on
his part, and one for which he alone had been
responsible.</p>
<p>Of course he might quite justly declare that
he could not possibly have foreseen all the other
moves fate had up her sleeve; but then no living
being could have foreseen them. Fate never does
show her subsequent moves. She puts decisions
before us in such a way, that she leaves us to
imagine we can shape our succeeding actions to our
own mind and according to the decision made.
She leaves us to imagine it is simply a question
whether we will reach our goal by a road bearing
slightly to the right or to the left, by a road which
may take a long time to traverse and be a fairly
smooth road, or a road which will take a short
time to traverse and be a rough one. Or, even, as
in Antony&#8217;s case, she will leave us to imagine there
is one route and one route only by which we may
reach our goal. And then, whatever our choice,
she may suddenly plant a huge barrier across the
path, labelled,&mdash;No thoroughfare to your goal in
this direction.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is possible to defy fate, retrace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
our steps, and start anew towards the goal. Occasionally
we will find that we have burnt our bridges
behind us; we are up against an obstacle, and there
we are bound to remain helpless. And here fate
appears at her worst trickery.</p>
<p>And even supposing we are minded to call it
not fate, but Providence, who does these things,
it will be of remarkably little comfort to us when
we are aware of our own blunders in the background.</p>
<p>A hundred times Antony reviewed the past; a
hundred times he blamed himself for the part he
had chosen. It is true that, so far as he could see,
none other would have had the smallest chance of
leading him to his desired goal, yet any other
could not have raised the enormous barrier he now
saw before him.</p>
<p>He had angered her: she despised him.</p>
<p>To his mind nothing, no subsequent happening,
could alter that fact. There was the thought he
had to face, and behind him lay his own irredeemable
blunder.</p>
<p>Well, the only thing now left for him was to
live his life as it was, minus one spark of brightness.
Certainly he didn&#8217;t feel like singing, but whining
was no earthly good. And since he could not
sing, and would not whine, silence alone was left
him. He would work as best he could till the year
was out. He had no intention of going back on his
bargain, despite the uselessness of it. At the end
of the year, the Hall being his own property, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
would sell the place, and travel. Perhaps he would
go off shooting big game, or perhaps he would go
round the world. It did not much matter which,
so long as it prevented him from whining.</p>
<p>And quite possibly, though he would never have
any heart for singing, the day might come when he
would again be able to whistle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>IN THE CHURCH PORCH</h3>
</div>

<p>It was somewhere about the second week in
December that Trix became the recipient of another
letter, a letter quite as amazing, perplexing,
and extraordinary as that which she had perused
in the summer-house at Llandrindod Wells. They
had returned to London in October.</p>
<p>The letter was brought to her in the drawing-room
one evening about nine o&#8217;clock. Mrs.
Arbuthnot had gone out to a Bridge party.</p>
<p>Trix was engrossed in a rather exciting novel
at the moment, a blazing fire and an exceedingly
comfortable armchair adding to her blissful state
of well-being. Barely raising her eyes from the
book, she merely put out her hand and took the
letter from the tray. It was not till she had
come to the end of the chapter that she even
glanced at the handwriting. Then she saw that
the writing was Miss Tibbutt&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Now, a letter from Miss Tibbutt was of such
extremely rare occurrence that Trix immediately
leapt to the conclusion that Pia must be ill. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
was therefore with a distinct pang of uneasiness
that she broke the seal. This is what she read:</p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Trix,</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have made rather an astounding discovery.
At least I feel sure I&#8217;ve made it, I mean that I am
right in what I think. I have no one in whom I
can confide, as it certainly would not do to speak
to Pia on the subject,&mdash;I feel sure she would
rather I didn&#8217;t, so I am writing to you as I feel I
must tell someone. My dear, it sounds too
extraordinary for anything, and I can&#8217;t understand
it myself, but it is this. Pia knows the under-gardener
at the Hall, really knows him I mean, not
merely who he is, and that he is one of the gardeners,
and that he came to these parts last March, which,
of course, we all know.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found this out quite by accident, and will explain
the incident to you. You must forgive me
if I am lengthy; but I can only write in my own
way, dear Trix, and perhaps that will be a little
long-winded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday afternoon, which was Saturday, Pia
and I motored into Byestry, as she wanted to see
Father Dormer about something. I went into the
church, while she went to the presbytery. I
noticed a man in the church as I went in, a man in
workman&#8217;s clothes, but of course I did not pay
any particular attention to him. I knelt down by
one of the chairs near the door, and just beyond
St. Peter&#8217;s statue. I suppose I must have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
kneeling there about ten minutes when the man
got up. He didn&#8217;t genuflect, and I glanced
involuntarily at him. He didn&#8217;t notice me, because
I was partly hidden by St. Peter&#8217;s statue.
Then I saw it was the under-gardener,&mdash;Michael
Field, I believe his name is.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, the man looked dreadfully ill, and so
sad. It was the face of a man who had lost something
or someone very dear to him. He went
towards the porch, and just before he reached it, I
heard the door open. Whoever was coming in
must have met him just inside the church. There
was a sound of steps as if the person had turned
back into the porch with him. Then I heard
Pia&#8217;s voice, speaking impulsively and almost
involuntarily. At least I felt sure it was involuntarily.
It sounded exactly as if she couldn&#8217;t
help speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; she said, &#8216;you&#8217;ve been ill.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nothing of any consequence, Madam,&#8217; I
heard the man&#8217;s voice answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But it must have been of consequence,&#8217; I
heard Pia say. &#8216;Have you seen a doctor?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There was no need,&#8217; returned the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I heard Pia&#8217;s voice, impulsive and a
little bit impatient. She evidently had not seen
me in the church, and thought no one was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But there is need. Why don&#8217;t you go and
see Doctor Hilary?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am not ill enough to need doctors, Madam,&#8217;
returned the man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But you are,&#8217; returned Pia, in the way that
she insists when she is very anxious about anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the man give a little laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is exceedingly good of you to trouble concerning
me,&#8217; he said, &#8216;and I really don&#8217;t know why
you should.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said Pia quickly, &#8216;you need not be afraid
that I, personally, wish to interfere with you again.
You made it quite plain to me months ago that
you had no smallest wish for me to do so. But,
speaking simply as one human being to another, as
complete and entire strangers, even, I do ask you
to see a doctor.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there was a moment&#8217;s silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I think not,&#8217; I heard the man say presently.
&#8216;I am really not sufficiently interested in myself.
Though&mdash;&#8217; and then, Trix dear, he half stopped,
and his voice altered in the queerest way,&mdash;&#8216;the
fact that you have shown interest enough to ask me
to do so, has, curiously enough, made me feel
quite a good deal more important in my own
eyes.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You refused my friendship,&#8217; I heard Pia say,
and her voice shook a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I did,&#8217; said the man in rather a stern voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, Trix dear, there was a little silence.
Then Pia said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t intend again to offer a thing that
has once been rejected. I shall <i>never</i> do that.
But because we once were friends, or at all events,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
fancied ourselves friends, I do ask you to see Doctor
Hilary. That is all.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must have turned from him at once, because
she came into the church, and went up the aisle to
her own chair. She knelt down, and put her hands
over her eyes; and, Trix dearest, she was crying.
I am crying now when I think about it, so forgive
the blots on the paper. A minute later I heard
the door open and shut again, so I knew the man
had gone. I got up as softly as I could, and
slipped out of the church. It would never have
done for Pia to see me, and I was so thankful to
St. Peter for hiding me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear Trix, wasn&#8217;t it amazing? And
one of the most amazing things was that the man&#8217;s
voice and way of speaking was quite educated, not
the least as one would suppose a gardener would
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to the post-office and bought some
stamps, though I really had plenty at home, and
loitered about for nearly a quarter of an hour.
Then I thought I had better go and find Pia. I
met her coming out of the church. She was very
pale; but she smiled, and wanted to know where
I&#8217;d been, and I told her to the post-office. And
then we drove home together. Pia laughed and
chatted all the way, while my heart was in a
big lump in my throat, and I could hardly keep
from crying, like the foolish old woman that I
am. I ought to have been talking, and helping Pia
to pretend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She has been quite gay all to-day, and oddly
gentle too. But you know the kind of gayness.
And to-night my heart feels like breaking for her,
for there is some sad mystery I can&#8217;t fathom. So,
Trix dearest, I have written to you, because I cannot
keep it all to myself. And I am crying again
now, though I know I oughtn&#8217;t to. So I am going
to leave off, and say the rosary instead.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:6em;'>&#8220;Good night, my dear Trix.</p>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Your affectionate old friend,</p>
<p style=' margin-right:2em;'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Esther Tibbutt.</span></p>
</div>

<p>P.S. I wish you could come down here again.
Can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trix leant back in her chair, and drew a long
breath. The novel was utterly and entirely forgotten.
So <i>that</i> was what Pia&#8217;s letter had meant.
It was this man she had been thinking of all the
time. A dozen little unanswered questions were
answered now, a dozen queer little riddles solved.</p>
<p>Trix slid down off her chair on to the bear-skin
rug in front of the fire. She leant her arms
sideways on the chair, resting her chin upon them.
Most assuredly she must place the whole matter
clearly before her mind, in so far as possible. She
gazed steadily at the glowing coals, ruminative,
reflective.</p>
<p>And firstly it was presented to her mind as
the paramount fact, that it was the mention of this
man&mdash;this Michael Field, so-called&mdash;that had
been the direct cause of Pia&#8217;s odd irritability, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
not the indirect cause, as she most erroneously had
imagined. Somehow, in some way, he had caused
her such pain that the mere mention of his name
had been like laying a hand roughly on a wound.
Secondly, though Trix most promptly dismissed
the memory, there was Pia&#8217;s hurting little speech,
the speech which had followed on her&mdash;Trix&#8217;s&mdash;theories
promulgated beneath the lime trees. In
the light of Miss Tibbutt&#8217;s letter that speech was
easy enough of explanation. Had not Pia had
practical proof of the unworkableness of those
theories? Proof which must have hurt her quite
considerably. How utterly and entirely childish
her words must have seemed to Pia,&mdash;Pia who
<i>knew</i>, while she truly was merely surmising, setting
forth ideas which assuredly she had never attempted
to put into practice. Thirdly&mdash;Trix
ticked off the facts on her fingers&mdash;there was the
amazing little game of cross-questions. That too
was entirely explained. How precisely it was
explained she did not attempt to put into actual
formulated words. Nevertheless she perceived
quite clearly that it was explained. And lastly
there was Pia&#8217;s letter to her, the letter which had
vainly tried to hide the bitterness which had
prompted it. Clear as daylight now was the
explanation of that letter. Buoyed up by Trix&#8217;s
advice, by Trix&#8217;s eloquence, she had once more
attempted to put the high-sounding theories
into practice. And it had proved a failure, an
utter and complete failure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>All these things fell at once into place, fitting
together like the pieces of a puzzle, an unfinished
puzzle, nevertheless. The largest pieces were still
scattered haphazard on the board, and there
seemed extremely little prospect of fitting them
into the rest. How had Pia ever met the man?
What was he doing at Chorley Old Hall? And
why was he pretending to be Michael Field, when
she&mdash;Trix&mdash;now knew him to be Antony Gray?
The last two proved the greatest difficulty, nor
could Trix, for all her gazing into the fire, find
the place they ought to occupy. She remembered,
too, her own idea regarding the colour of that
bubble. Was it possible that she had been right
in her idea? Verily, if she had been, in the face of
this new discovery, it opened up a yet more astounding
problem. Pia actually and verily in love
with the man, a man she believed to be under-gardener
at the Hall,&mdash;Pia, the distant, the proud,
the reserved Pia! It was amazing, unthinkable!</p>
<p>Trix heaved a sigh; it was all quite beyond
her. One thing alone was obvious; she must go
down to Woodleigh again as soon as possible.
Certainly she had no very clear notion as to what
precise good she could do by going, nevertheless
she was entirely convinced that go she must.
And then, having reached this point in her reflections,
she returned once more to the beginning, and
began all over again.</p>
<p>And suddenly another idea struck her, one
which had been entirely omitted from her former
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
train of thought. Was it possible that Mr.
Danver knew of the identity of this Michael
Field? Was it possible, was it conceivable that
he held the key to those greatest riddles? Truly
it would seem possible. His one big action had
been so extraordinary, so mad even, that it would
be quite justifiable to believe, or at least conjecture,
that minor extraordinary actions might be
mixed up with it.</p>
<p>And then, from that, Trix turned to a somewhat
more detailed consideration of Pia&#8217;s position.
One point presented itself quite definitely and
clearly to her. It was certainly evident from
that memorable letter of Pia&#8217;s, that she <i>did</i> regard
this man as a social inferior, from which fact it was
entirely plain that she had no smallest notion of his
real identity. Trix clasped her hands beneath her
chin, shut her eyes, and plunged yet deeper into
her reflections. They were becoming even more
intricate.</p>
<p>Now, would it be a comfort to Pia to know that
this man was by birth her social equal, or would it,
in view of the fact that he had in some way shown
her what she had called &#8220;a glimpse of the hairy
hoof,&#8221; appear to her an added insult. Trix
pondered the question deeply, turning it in her
mind, and sighing prodigiously more than once
in the process.</p>
<p>And then, all at once, she opened her eyes.
Where, after all, was the use of troubling her
head on that score. Comfort or not, who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
to tell Pia? Most assuredly Trix couldn&#8217;t. She
had considered that question already, weeks ago
in fact, and answered it in the negative. Of course
it was quite possible that she was being somewhat
over-sensitive and ultra-scrupulous on the subject.
But there it was. It was the way she regarded
matters.</p>
<p>Trix sighed deeply. It was all terribly perplexing,
and Tibby&#8217;s letter was quite horribly
pathetic. Anyhow she would go down to Woodleigh
as soon as she possibly could.</p>
<p>She had been so entirely engrossed with her
reflections, that she had quite forgotten the passing
of time. It was with a start of surprise,
therefore, that she heard the door open. At
the selfsame moment the clock on the mantelpiece
chimed the hour of midnight. Trix got to
her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dearest,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Arbuthnot,
&#8220;not gone to bed yet! And all the beauty sleep
before midnight, they tell us. Not that you need
it except in the way of preservation, dearest. For
I always did tell you, regardless of making you
conceited which I do not think I do do, that I
have admired you from the time you were in
your cradle. Well, food is the next best thing to
sleep, so come and have a sandwich and some
sherry. I am famished, positively famished.
And I ate an excellent dinner, I know; but Bridge
is always hungry work. Bring the tray to the
fire, dearest. I see James has put it all ready.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
And ham, which I adore. It may be indigestible,
though I never believe it with things I like. Not
merely because I like to think so, but because it is
true. Nature knows best, as she knew when I was
a child, and gave me a distaste for fat which always
upset me, and a great appreciation for oranges
which doctors are crying up tremendously nowadays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot sank down in an armchair, and
threw back her cloak. Trix brought the tray to a
small table near her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how have you been amusing yourself,
dearest? Not dull, I hope? But the fire and a
book are always the best of companions I think, to
say nothing of one&#8217;s own thoughts, though some
people do consider day-dreaming waste of time.
So narrow-minded. They read novels which are
only other people&#8217;s day-dreams, and their own less
expensive, as saving library subscriptions and the
buying of books, besides a certain superiority in
feeling they are your own. On the whole more
satisfactory, too. Even though you know the end
before you come to it, it can always be arranged
as you like, and sad or happy to suit your mood.
Though for my part it should always be happy. If
you&#8217;re happy you want it happy, and if you&#8217;re not,
you still want it to make you. If it weren&#8217;t
for the difficulty of dividing into chapters, I&#8217;d write
my own day-dreams, and no doubt have a big
sale. But publishers have an absurd prejudice
in favour of chapters, and even headings, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
means an average of thirty titles. Quite brain-racking.
A dear friend of mine who wrote, told
me she always thought the title the most difficult
part of a book.&#8221;</p>
<p>She helped herself to a glass of sherry
and two sandwiches as she concluded her
speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you really have a pleasant evening?&#8221;
said Trix, politely interrogative.</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot surveyed her sandwich reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dearest, on the whole, yes. But unfortunately
Mrs. Townsend was there. An excellent
Bridge player, and I am always pleased to see
her myself, but some people are so odd in their
manner towards her. Quite embarrassing really,
in fact awkward at times. Absurd, too, with so
good a player. And though her father was a grocer
it was in the wholesale line, which is different
from the retail. Besides, she married well, and
doesn&#8217;t drop her aitches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s chin went up. &#8220;I hate class distinctions
being made so horribly obvious,&#8221; said she with
fine scorn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dearest, in Mrs. Townsend&#8217;s case, perhaps.
But not always. I remember a girl I
knew married a farmer. Most foolish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why, if he was nice?&#8221; demanded Trix,
exceedingly firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but dearest,&#8221; ejaculated Mrs. Arbuthnot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
&#8220;it was so unsuitable. He wasn&#8217;t even a gentleman
farmer. He had been a labourer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might have been a nice labourer,&#8221; contended
Trix.</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot sighed. &#8220;In himself, possibly.
But it wouldn&#8217;t do. The irritation afterwards.
We are told to avoid occasions of sin, and it would
not be avoiding occasions of ill-temper if you
married a man like that. Beer and muddy boots,
to say nothing of inferior tobacco. The glamour
passed, though for my part I cannot see how
there ever would be any glamour, probably
infatuation, the boots&mdash;you know the kind,
dearest, great nails and smelling of leather&mdash;the
beer and the tobacco would be so terribly obvious.
No, dearest, it doesn&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix was silent. After all wasn&#8217;t she again arguing
on a point regarding which she had had no
real experience? Pia had tried the experiment,
and declared it didn&#8217;t work; and that, in the case
of a man who <i>was</i> of gentle birth, though posing as
a labourer. In her own mind she felt it ought to
work,&mdash;of course under certain circumstances. It
was not the birth, but the mind that mattered.
And, if there were the right kind of mind, there
most certainly would not be the boots, the beer,
and the tobacco. Trix was perfectly sure there
wouldn&#8217;t be. But it evidently was no atom of
good trying to explain to other people what
she meant, because they entirely failed to understand,
and she was not certain that she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
explain very well to herself even what she did
mean.</p>
<p>It was not in the least that she had ever had
the smallest desire to run counter to these conventions
in any really important way, but she did hate
hard and fast rules. Why should people lay down
laws, as rigid as the laws of the Medes and Persians
on matters that did not involve actual questions
of right and wrong! There were enough of those
to observe, without inventing others which were
not in the least necessary.</p>
<p>It was all horribly muddling, and rather depressing,
she decided. She finished her sandwich and
glass of sherry, swallowing a little lump in her
throat at the same time. Then she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Lilla,&#8221; she said impulsively, &#8220;I want
to go down to Woodleigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woodleigh, dearest. You were there only a
little time ago, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in August,&#8221; said Trix. &#8220;And, anyhow,
I want to go again. You don&#8217;t mind, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot took another sandwich.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fifth,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Disgraceful,
but all the fault of Bridge. Why, of course not, if
you want to go. But what made you think of it
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix leant back in her chair. &#8220;I had a letter
from Miss Tibbutt,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot laid down her sandwich. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
regarded Trix with anxious and almost reproachful
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dearest, nothing wrong I hope? So
inconsiderate of me to talk of Bridge. I saw a
letter in your hand, but no black edge. Unless
there is a black edge, one does not readily imagine
bad news. Not like telegrams. They send my
heart to my mouth, and generally nothing but a
Bridge postponement. So trivial. But it is the
colour of the envelope, and the possibility. Ill
news flies apace, and telegrams the quickest mode
of communicating it. Except the telephone.
And that is expensive at any distance.&#8221; Mrs.
Arbuthnot paused, and took up her sandwich
once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; responded Trix, answering the first
sentence of the speech. Experience, long experience
had taught her to seize upon the first half-dozen
words of her aunt&#8217;s discourses, and cling to
them, allowing the remainder to float harmlessly
into thin air. Later there might be the necessity
to clutch at a few more, but generally the first half-dozen
sufficed. &#8220;Oh, no; no bad news. But Miss
Tibbutt is not quite satisfied about Pia.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was true, at all events.</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot made a little clicking sound
with her tongue, expressive of sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dearest, I know that term &#8216;not quite
satisfied.&#8217; So vague. It may mean nothing, or
it may mean a good deal. And we always think
it means a good deal, when it is probably only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
influenza. Depressing, but not at all serious if
taken in time. And ammoniated quinine the best
thing possible. Not bitter, either, if taken in
capsule form. But I quite feel with you, and go-by
all means if you wish. And take eucalyptus,
with you to avoid catching it yourself. So infectious,
they say, but not to be shirked if one is
needed. I would never stand in the light of duty.
The corporal works of mercy, inconvenient at
times, and I have never been to see a prisoner in
my life, but perhaps easier than the spiritual,
except the three last. You always run the risk
of interference with the first of the spiritual, so
wiser to leave them entirely to priests. When do
you want to go, dearest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix came to herself with a little start. She
had lost the thread of Mrs. Arbuthnot&#8217;s discourse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day after to-morrow, I think,&#8221; she said,
reflectively. &#8220;I can wire to-morrow and get a
reply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Arbuthnot got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s settled. Don&#8217;t look anxious,
dearest, because there is probably no cause for it.
Though I know how easy it is to give advice, and
how difficult to take it, even when it is oneself.
Though perhaps that is really harder, being often
half-hearted. And now we will go to bed, and
things will look brighter in the morning, especially
if it is fine. And the glass going up as I came
through the hall. Quite time it did. I always had
sympathy with the boy in the poem&mdash;Jane and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Anne Taylor, wasn&#8217;t it?&mdash;who smashed the glass
in the holidays because it wouldn&#8217;t go up. It
always seems as if it were its fault. Though I
know it&#8217;s foolish to think so. And there is the
clock striking one, and I shall eat more sandwiches
if I stay, so let us put out the light, and go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>A QUESTION OF IMPORTANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>It had been chance pure and simple which
happened to take Doctor Hilary to Woodleigh on
the day the Duchessa received Trix&#8217;s telegram, but
it cannot be equally said that it was chance which
took him to Exeter on the following day, and
which made him travel down again to Kingsleigh
by the four o&#8217;clock train. Also it was certainly
not chance which induced him to be on the platform
at least a quarter of an hour before the train
was due at the station, ready to keep a careful
lookout on all the passengers in it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Trix had had an uneasy journey from London.
She had re-read Miss Tibbutt&#8217;s letter at least a
dozen times. At first she had allowed herself
to be almost unreasonably depressed by it; afterwards
she had been almost more unreasonably
depressed because she had allowed herself to be
depressed in the first instance. Quite possibly
it was all a storm in a tea-cup, and this man had
nothing whatever to do with Pia&#8217;s unhappiness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
Of course the chance meeting and the overheard
conversation had fitted in so neatly as to make
Miss Tibbutt think it had, and she had easily
communicated the same idea to Trix. But quite
probably it had nothing more to do with it than
her own surmise regarding Doctor Hilary had had.
And that had proved entirely erroneous, though at
the time it had appeared the most sane of conclusions.
Also Miss Tibbutt might quite conceivably
be wrong as to Pia&#8217;s being now unhappy at all,
whatever she had seemed to be in the summer.</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s visit began to appear to her somewhat
in the light of a wild-goose chase. Anyhow she
had not given Pia the smallest hint as to why
she was coming. Naturally she could not possibly
have done that. She had still to invent some tangible
excuse for her sudden desire to visit Woodleigh
again. Sick of London greyness would be quite
good enough, though certainly not entirely true.
But possibly a slight deviation from truth would be
excusable under the circumstances. And she <i>was</i>
sick of London greyness. The fog yesterday had
got on her nerves altogether, though quite probably
it would not have done so if it had not been
for Miss Tibbutt&#8217;s letter, which had made her feel
so horribly restless. But then there was no need
to say why the fog had got on her nerves.</p>
<p>Yes; the fog would be excuse enough. And
it was not an atom of good worrying herself as to
whether Miss Tibbutt had been right or wrong
regarding the idea communicated in her letter. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
she were right it made Trix unhappy to think about
it, and if she were wrong it made Trix cross to
think she <i>had</i> thought about it. So the wisest
course was not to think about it at all. But
the difficulty was not to think about it.</p>
<p>Trix knew perfectly well that absurd little
things had this power of depressing her, and she
wished they had not. She knew, also, that other
quite little things had the power of cheering her in
equal proportion, and she wished that one of these
other things would happen now. But that was not
particularly likely.</p>
<p>The depression had been at its lowest ebb as
they ran into Bath. It was, however, slightly on
the mend by the time Trix reached Exeter, though
she was still feeling that her journey had probably,
if not certainly, been a piece of pure foolishness
on her part.</p>
<p>The carriage she was in was up in the front
of the train. She was the sole occupant thereof.
She now put up something akin to a prayer that
she might remain in undisturbed possession.
Apparently, however, the prayer was not to be
granted. A tall figure, masculine in character,
suddenly blocked the light from the window.
Trix heaved a small sigh of patient resignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Miss Devereux,&#8221; said a voice.</p>
<p>Trix looked up. Her resignation took to itself
wings and fled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Hilary!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary heaved his big form into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
carriage, and turned to take a tea-basket from a
porter just behind him. First tipping the said
porter, he put the basket carefully on the seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for you,&#8221; he remarked
calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Trix, a trifle surprised.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary sat down, keeping, however, one
eye towards the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he continued, still calmly. &#8220;The Duchessa
happened to tell me yesterday that you
were coming, and as I happened to be in Exeter to-day
I thought we might as well do this bit of the
journey together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Trix.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary looked up. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mind, do
you?&#8221; he asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind!&#8221; echoed Trix, &#8220;I am quite delighted.
I&#8217;ve been so bored, and rather tired, and&mdash;yes,
I think quite depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary looked concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor little thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I
suppose you have had one sandwich, and no tea.
Men turn to food when they&#8217;re depressed, and
women think they can&#8217;t eat. Honestly, there&#8217;s
nothing like a good meal for helping one to look
on the brighter side of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix smiled first at him, and then at the tea-basket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow I&#8217;m to be fed now, it seems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The train began to move slowly out of the
station. Doctor Hilary gave vent to an ill-supressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
sigh of relief. The train was non-stop
to Brent. He began pulling at the straps of the
tea-basket.</p>
<p>Tea and Doctor Hilary&#8217;s company had a really
marvellous effect on Trix&#8217;s spirits. The little
pleasant occurrence <i>had</i> happened, and quite
unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re coming down to Woodleigh,&#8221;
said Doctor Hilary presently. &#8220;The Duchessa
has seemed out of sorts lately, and I fancy your
coming will cheer her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Trix, &#8220;you think so, too.&#8221; And
then she stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else thinks so?&#8221; queried Doctor Hilary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Tibbutt didn&#8217;t seem quite satisfied
about her,&#8221; owned Trix. &#8220;It was a letter from her
made me come. And then I thought perhaps she&#8217;d
been mistaken, and I&#8217;d been silly to think there
was any need of me, and that&mdash;well, that I&#8217;d been
a little officious. It&#8217;s a depressing sensation,&#8221;
sighed Trix.</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that was the cause of the depression,&#8221;
quoth he.</p>
<p>Trix nodded. &#8220;It was rather silly, wasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not sure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was such an idiotic little thing to worry
about,&#8221; said Trix</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. But isn&#8217;t it just the little things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
we <i>do</i> worry over? They are so small, you know,
it&#8217;s difficult to handle them. It is far easier not to
worry over a thing you can get a real grasp of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix smiled gratefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad you understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
am always doing things on impulse. I fancy I am
indispensable, I suppose, and then all at once I
think what a little donkey I am to have interfered.
It is so easy to think oneself important to other
people&#8217;s welfare when one isn&#8217;t a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Doctor Hilary quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; replied Trix. There was a
hint of indignation in her voice. &#8220;And please
don&#8217;t say I am, or else it will make me feel that
you think I said what I did say just in order that
you might contradict me. Like fishing for a
compliment, you know. And I didn&#8217;t mean that
in the least, I didn&#8217;t truly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Hilary smiled, a queer little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t mean that. But all the
same I am going to contradict you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix looked up. &#8220;Oh well,&#8221; she began, laughing
and half resignedly. And then something
in Doctor Hilary&#8217;s face made her stop suddenly,
her heart beating at a mad pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have become very important in my life,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;I did not realize how important,
till you went away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not very good at making pretty speeches,&#8221;
said Doctor Hilary steadily, &#8220;but I hope you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
understand exactly what I mean. You have
become so important to my welfare that I should
find it exceedingly difficult to go on living without
you. I suppose I should do it somehow if I must,
but probably I should make a very poor job of it.&#8221;
He stopped.</p>
<p>Trix gave a sudden little intake of her breath.
For a moment there was a dead silence. Then:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you always feed me when I am depressed?&#8221;
she asked. And there was a little quiver half of
laughter, half of tears, in her voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>MIDNIGHT REFLECTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Tibby angel, you were quite right.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the sixth time Trix had made the same
remark in the last half hour, and she had made it
each time with the same attentive deliberation as if
the words were being only once spoken, though
she knew she would probably have to say them
at least six times more.</p>
<p>She was sitting in front of her bedroom fire
clad in a blue dressing-gown. Miss Tibbutt was
sitting in an armchair opposite to her. She had
come into the room presumably for two minutes
only, to see that Trix had all she wanted, but after
she had fluttered for full ten minutes from dressing-table
to bed, and back to dressing-table again,
talking all the time, Trix had firmly pushed her
into an armchair.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt took off her spectacles, and
polished them slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is to be done, Trix dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know just at the moment. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
see, though we are pretty certain, we are not
quite certain. I know I thought last August
that Pia was in love with someone, and now you
say you are certain it is this man, and of course,
as you say&mdash;&#8221; Trix hesitated a moment, feeling
slightly hypocritical,&mdash;&#8220;it does seem odd when he
is only a gardener, and one wonders how she
could have met him, and all that. But, you
know, you are not <i>quite</i> certain that you are
right; or, even supposing that you are, that
Pia will want any interference on our part. We
must just wait a day or two and think matters
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you <i>do</i> think I was right to let you know?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>And a seventh time Trix replied with careful
deliberation,</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Tibby angel, you were quite right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Miss Tibbutt, &#8220;I thought&mdash;&#8221;
And she related exactly what she had thought, all
over again.</p>
<p>Trix listened exceedingly patiently. She did
not even know she was being patient. She only
knew the enormous relief it was to Miss Tibbutt to
repeat herself. With each repetition the thought
which had choked her mind, so to speak, for the
last five days, was further cleared from her brain.
It was quite possible that Miss Tibbutt might
sleep a very great deal better that night than she
had done lately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>At last she stopped speaking, and looked
towards the clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, I had no idea it was so late. You
must be tired after your journey, and here have I
been thinking only of myself again, and of my own
anxiety, and not of you at all. I am not going
to keep you up a moment longer. And if I am late
for breakfast, please tell Pia I have gone to Mass.
The walk won&#8217;t hurt me, and telling our dear
Lord all about it will be the best way to help Pia.
So good night, dear. And you are really not
looking very tired in spite of your journey, and my
having kept you up so late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix went with her to the door, and then returned
to her chair by the fire. She was not in the
least sleepy, and bed would do quite well enough
later. Just now she wanted to think. There
were two distinct trends of thought in which she
wished to indulge; the one certainly contained
cause for a little anxiety, the other was quite
extraordinarily delicious. She must take the
anxious trend first.</p>
<p>She had been considering matters exceedingly
earnestly all the while Miss Tibbutt had been
talking to her, and she had come to one very
definite conclusion. She felt perfectly certain
now, that it <i>would</i> ease the situation considerably
if Pia knew who this Michael Field really was.
It had come to her in an illuminating flash, that
the same reason which had caused him to hide
his identity, was responsible for his odd behaviour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
towards Pia. Now, of course, if Pia could see some
even possible reason and excuse for the oddness of
his behaviour, it must be a great comfort to her.
But the question was, could she&mdash;Trix&mdash;tell her?
Would not the telling probably involve her in the
untruth her soul loathed? Or, if she was firm not
to tell lies, would it not somehow involve a breaking
of her promise to Nicholas? Again she saw, or
thought she saw, all the questions which must
ensue if she said where she had met the man; and if
she did not say where she had met him, it would
probably mean saying something which, virtually
speaking at least, would not be true. If only she
had not met him in the grounds of Chorley Old
Hall.</p>
<p>It was the same old problem which had presented
itself to her mind twice already, and the same
possible over-scrupulosity was perplexing her now.
However, she must stop thinking about it for
to-night. She had come to an end of these
thoughts so far as she could muster them into
shape, and it was not the least particle of use going
over them again. Her brain would run round
like a squirrel in a cage, if she did. And Tibby
was not with her to open the cage door, as she had
opened it for Tibby. Besides, there was the
other trend now.</p>
<p>She settled herself back among the cushions,
and gazed at the dancing flames. It was all so
wonderful, so gorgeously unexpected, and yet
it was one of those things which just had to be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
She was so sure of that, it made the happening
doubly sweet. It was exactly as if she had been
walking all her life through a quiet wood, a wood
where the sunshine flickered through the trees
overhead just sufficiently to make her feel quite
certain of the existence of the sunshine, and then
suddenly she had come out into its full warmth
and beauty to behold a perfect landscape. And
she knew that no single other path could have led
her to this place, also that there could be no other
prospect as beautiful for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you first know?&#8221; she had asked him.
The question millions of women have asked in
their time, and that will be asked by millions
more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he had answered smiling, &#8220;it was
the very first moment you came into the room,
looking like a woodland elf in your green frock.
Anyhow I am quite certain it was when you were&mdash;shall
we say a trifle snubbed in the moonlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, poor Pia,&#8221; said Trix.</p>
<p>And then they had told each other countless
little trivial things, things of no earthly importance
to any one but their two selves, things rendered
sweet, not so much by the words, as by the
tone in which they were spoken. It had been
the old, old story, the story which began in all its
first beauty in the Garden of Eden, before the devil
had entered therein with his wiles, a story which
even now ofttimes holds much of that age-old
wonderful beauty. And the stuffy, fusty railway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
carriage had not in the least diminished the
joy of the telling.</p>
<p>Trix smiled to herself, a soft little radiant
smile.</p>
<p>To-morrow she must tell Pia. She gave a
little sigh. It would seem almost cruel to let her
know of their happiness.</p>
<p>For Trix&#8217;s own happiness to be without flaw,
it was invariably necessary that others should be
in practically the same state of bliss.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>SUNLIGHT AND HAPPINESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Sleep, they say, brings counsel. Most certainly
it brought counsel to Trix, and really such
simple counsel she marvelled that she had not
thought of it before.</p>
<p>After all, the question as to whether she should
or should not disclose Antony Gray&#8217;s identity to
Pia, and thereby run the risk either of untruth or
of breaking a promise, was purely a question of
conscience. Now, in a question of conscience, if
you cannot decide for yourself, it is always safe
to consult a priest. She would therefore walk
over to Byestry after breakfast&mdash;after she had
told Pia her own particular and wonderful news&mdash;and
consult Father Dormer. It would be quite
easy to explain matters to him without mentioning
names.</p>
<p>Trix began formulating her query in her mind
as she dressed. By the time this process was
completed, however, she had come to the conclusion
that she was not altogether sure whether it
would be so easy. She found herself getting wound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
up into rather extraordinary knots. Well, anyhow
she would explain somehow, and no doubt
words would come when she was actually confronted
with him. Besides, it was never the smallest
use arranging conversations beforehand, like a
French conversation book, because people never
gave the right answers to your questions, and
never put the questions to which you had the
answers ready.</p>
<p>Trix crossed slowly to the window. There
had been a frost in the night, and the lower part of
the window-pane was covered with magic fern
fronds, while lawn and shrubs were clothed with a
light white veil.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sun came up behind the distant
hills, a glowing ball of fire, sending forth his ruddy
beams till they struck clean through the window,
turning the fern fronds to ruby jewels, and making
of the frost veil without a web of diamonds.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; breathed Trix softly, &#8220;is what happened
to us yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she knelt down quite suddenly by the window.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The breakfast hour at the Manor House was,
ordinarily speaking, most punctually at nine
o&#8217;clock, but owing, doubtless, to some slight
hitch in the lower regions, the gong that morning
did not sound till a quarter past the hour. This
delay gave Miss Tibbutt time to put in an appearance
not more than two minutes late, and saved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
any necessary explanation regarding her early walk
to Byestry. As it was really on Pia&#8217;s account
that she had gone to Mass, she wished to avoid
mentioning that she had been. Of course Pia
could not possibly have guessed the real motive,
but Miss Tibbutt had a feeling, which reason
told her to be quite foolish, that in some odd way
she might guess. And she did not want her to
guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the plan of campaign to-day?&#8221; asked
the Duchessa, as they assembled in the morning
room after breakfast.</p>
<p>Trix examined an ornament on the mantelpiece
with rather studied care.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of walking over to Byestry,
this morning,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed the Duchessa, &#8220;and after
lunch we will have the car. It is cold, but too good
a day to be wasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix had a moment&#8217;s anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t be late for tea?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; responded Pia. &#8220;The
days are too short now. But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix put down the ornament she was examining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Hilary is coming to tea,&#8221; she announced
carelessly, though she knew perfectly
well that the colour was rising in her cheeks.</p>
<p>Pia looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trix!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, darling,&#8221; nodded Trix, &#8220;just that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my Trix!&#8221; cried Pia delighted, putting
her arms round her.</p>
<p>Miss Tibbutt looked a trifle bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she demanded</p>
<p>Pia laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Trix and Doctor
Hilary. I told you, you remember, and said
there <i>were</i> trains, though I never dreamed they
would be utilized quite so literally. Of course it
<i>was</i> yesterday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Trix again. And then with a
huge sigh, &#8220;Oh, Pia, I am so happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pia turned her round towards Miss Tibbutt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tibby, look at her face, and then she tells
us she is happy, as though it were necessary to
advertise the fact to our slow intelligences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix laughed, though the tears were in her eyes.
Laughter and tears are amazingly close together
at times.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is it quite necessary to walk to Byestry
this morning?&#8221; teased Pia. &#8220;He will probably
be on his rounds, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Trix laughed, this time without the tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not proposing to sit in his pocket,&#8221; she
remarked. &#8220;He did not happen to suggest that I
should, and it certainly never occurred to me to
suggest it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>TRIX SEEKS ADVICE</h3>
</div>

<p>Trix walked along the road from Woodleigh to
Byestry in infinitely too happy a state of mind to
think consistently of any one thing. She did not
even think precisely definitely of the man who had
caused this happiness. She knew only that the
happiness was there.</p>
<p>The hoar frost still lay thickly on the hedges
and the grass by the roadside. The frost finger
had outlined the twigs, the blades of grass, the
veins of dried leaves with the delicate precision
nature alone can achieve. At one spot a tiny
rivulet, arrested by the ice-king in its course from
a field and down a bank, hung in long glistening
icicles from jutting stones and frozen earth. Now
and again her own footfall struck sharp and
metallic on the hard road. The sky was cloudless,
a clear, cold blue. A robin trilled its sweet, sad
song to her from a frosted bough.</p>
<p>It was all amazingly like a frosted Christmas
card, thought Trix, those Christmas cards her
soul had adored in her childish days, and yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
which, oddly enough, always brought with them a
sentimental touch of sadness. Many things had
brought this odd happy sadness to Trix as a child,&mdash;the
sound of church bells across water, fire-light
gleaming in the darkness from the uncurtained
windows of some house, the moon shining on snow,
a solitary tree backgrounded by a grey sky, or a
flight of rooks at sunset.</p>
<p>It was a quarter to eleven or thereabouts when
she reached Byestry, and she made her way at once
to the little white-washed, thatched presbytery,
separated from the road by a small front garden.</p>
<p>Trix walked up the path, and rang the bell.
Father Dormer was at home, so his housekeeper
announced, and she was shown into a small square
room with a round table in the centre, and a vase
of bronze chrysanthemums on the table.</p>
<p>Trix sat down and began to try and arrange
her ideas. She was by now perfectly well aware
that they were not only rather difficult to arrange,
but would be infinitely more difficult to express.
She sighed once or twice rather heavily, gazing
thoughtfully at the bronze chrysanthemums the
while, as if seeking inspiration from their feathery
brown faces. And then the door opened and
Father Dormer came in in his cassock, which he
always wore in the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an unexpected pleasure to see you, Miss
Devereux,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Please sit down again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix sat down, and so did Father Dormer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only arrived yesterday,&#8221; said Trix, &#8220;and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
came over to see you this morning because I
wanted to ask you something rather particular.&#8221;
Trix was feeling just a little nervous, she was also
feeling that if she did not open the subject immediately,
it was quite possible that she might leave the
presbytery without having done so, despite all her
preconceived intentions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; smiled Father Dormer. He was perfectly
well aware that she was feeling a trifle nervous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Trix, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t going to be quite
easy to explain, because I can&#8217;t mention names.
But as it is a thing I can&#8217;t make up my mind
about,&mdash;about the right or wrong of doing it, I
mean,&mdash;I thought I&#8217;d ask your advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is always at your service,&#8221; he assured
her as she stopped.</p>
<p>Trix heaved a little sigh. She leant forward
in her chair, and rested her hands on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Father, it&#8217;s like this. I know
something about someone which another person
doesn&#8217;t know, and I think it is rather important
that they should know it. The first person doesn&#8217;t
know I know it, and mightn&#8217;t quite like it if they
knew I knew it. Also I am pretty sure that they
don&#8217;t want any one else to know it. But under
the circumstances I think I&#8217;m justified in telling
the second person, because it isn&#8217;t a thing like a
scandal, or anything like that. But the difficulty
is, that in telling the second person about the
first person, I may either have to tell lies, or disclose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
a secret about a third person, and that is a
secret I have promised not to tell. Do you think
I ought to take the risk?&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Dormer listened attentively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind saying it again,&#8221; he asked
politely as she ended. There was just the faintest
possible twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>Trix laughed outright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Father, don&#8217;t try to be polite,&#8221; she urged.
&#8220;I know it is the muddliest kind of explanation
that ever existed. Can&#8217;t you suggest some way of
making it clearer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you call the first person
A, the second B, and the third one C. And let me
know first exactly your position towards A.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Trix cheerfully. &#8220;And
even supposing you guess the tiniest bit what I am
talking about, you won&#8217;t let yourself guess, will
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Dormer assured her that he would not.
He certainly felt she need have no smallest anxiety
on that score, having in view her own method of
explanation, but he tactfully refrained from saying
so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; began Trix again, and rather slowly,
&#8220;A has a secret. He doesn&#8217;t know I know it, and
I found it out quite by accident. He hasn&#8217;t said it
is a secret, but I know it is, because nobody else
knows about it. Well, B knows A, but doesn&#8217;t
know A&#8217;s secret, and because she doesn&#8217;t know A&#8217;s
secret she is unhappy about A&#8217;s conduct, whereas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
if she knew the secret I am pretty sure she wouldn&#8217;t
be so unhappy. And A need never know B does
know, even if I tell her. And I feel sure from A&#8217;s
point of view it would not matter telling B, while
it <i>would</i> be a good thing for B to know. But, in
order to tell her, I may have to let her know how
I learnt A&#8217;s secret, and in doing that I should
possibly have to tell lies, or let her know C&#8217;s secret,
which I promised not to tell. Because it was in
meeting A that I found it out. Of course I may
not have to do either, but there is the risk. Do you
think I can take it? And is the matter quite
clear now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Dormer smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have grasped it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well,
in the first place, it isn&#8217;t a matter of life and death,
is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if I were you, I wouldn&#8217;t take any risk
about telling lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Trix relieved, &#8220;I thought I had
better not. But then there is C&#8217;s secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us take A&#8217;s secret first,&#8221; suggested Father
Dormer. &#8220;You feel quite sure it is important to
let B know it, and that you are justified in disclosing
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel quite sure it is important B should
know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I feel pretty sure I am
justified in disclosing it. At first I thought perhaps
I ought not to do so. But I know B won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
tell any one else, so it can&#8217;t matter her knowing as
well as me. No; I am sure it can&#8217;t,&#8221; ended Trix
decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Father Dormer, &#8220;your best plan
will be to ask C to release you from your promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but&mdash;&#8221; she began. She shook her head.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he would ever release me,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could ask him, anyhow,&#8221; said Father
Dormer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I could,&#8221; replied Trix doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try that first,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;It is the
simplest plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Trix still doubtfully.</p>
<p>Of course it sounded the simplest plan to Father
Dormer, but then he had not the remotest idea of
what the secret was, nor whom it concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Trix thoughtfully, &#8220;he knows
A&#8217;s secret too; at least, I feel sure he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; smiled Father Dormer, &#8220;it is not
quite such a secret as you imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it is,&#8221; nodded Trix. &#8220;It is the
most complicated affair that ever was, and the
most extraordinary. Nobody would believe it if
they didn&#8217;t know.&#8221; She sighed.</p>
<p>Father Dormer watched her. He saw that she
evidently did consider it a complicated situation,
though, in spite of her rather complicated explanation
it had appeared quite simple to him. At all
events, the solution had. It had not even&mdash;as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
soon as he had grasped the question she had come
to ask&mdash;appeared to involve much difficulty of
answering. It was quite obvious she ought not to
run the risk of telling lies (he could guess that her
honesty would make it exceedingly difficult for
her to evade any awkward questions without
telling them), mainly because it was never right
to tell lies, but also because the smallest white
one&mdash;so-called&mdash;would appear extremely black
to Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that settled now?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Trix. She looked at her watch.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve two hours; I had better do it at once.&#8221;
Then she stopped suddenly. &#8220;Oh, Father!&#8221;
she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t guess, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I?&#8221; he asked smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, because saying that told you that C lived
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;My dear child, when you arrive
at Woodleigh one day, and ask me a rather complicated
question the next, it is perfectly obvious it
is one which has to be settled in this neighbourhood,
and at once. I could hardly imagine you
have travelled down here on purpose to consult
me; or that, if it were a question to be settled in
town, you would not wait till your return to consult
some other priest on the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of that,&#8221; she owned. &#8220;But,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
of course, it is quite obvious. Only I am so afraid
of breaking my promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had risen to her feet by now. He held
out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not worry about that, if I were you.
You have not broken it in the smallest degree.
But now go and get leave to break it, if you can,
and set your mind at rest.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>AN AMAZING SUGGESTION</h3>
</div>

<p>The avenue and garden were quite deserted as
Trix approached Chorley Old Hall. The lawn was
one great sheet of unbroken whiteness, flanked by
frosted yew hedges, and very desolate.</p>
<p>She passed quickly along the terrace towards
the front door, feeling almost as if spying eyes
were watching her from behind the curtained
windows. She took hold of the hanging iron bell-handle
and pulled it, its coldness striking through
her glove with an icy chill. She heard its clang in
some far-off region, yet oddly loud in the dead
silence. Involuntarily she shivered, partly with
the cold, and partly with a sudden sense of nervousness.</p>
<p>A second or two passed. Trix stared hard at
the brass knocker on the door, trying to still the
nervousness which possessed her. There came a
sound of steps in the hall, and the door was opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I see Mr. Danver?&#8221; asked Trix.</p>
<p>Jessop stared, visibly startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right,&#8221; said Trix quickly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you remember I had tea here last August?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>Jessop&#8217;s face relaxed, but he looked a trifle
dubious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>Trix raised her chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and ask him,&#8221; she said with slight authority.
&#8220;I will wait in the hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessop departed, to return after a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come this way, please, Madam.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Nicholas Danver looked at her as she entered,
an odd expression on his face.</p>
<p>He might never have moved from his chair since
the day she had last seen him, thought Trix. The
only difference in the surroundings was a crackling
wood fire now burning on the big hearth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Devereux,&#8221; he said, holding out his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind my having come?&#8221; queried
Trix. &#8220;No one saw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slight look of relief passed over Nicholas&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am glad you&#8217;ve come,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Sit down, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix sat down. Her hands were tightly clasped
within her muff. She was still beating back that
quite unaccountable nervousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had a particular reason for coming to see
me?&#8221; suggested Nicholas.</p>
<p>Trix nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I am in rather a difficulty. You are
the only person who can help me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>Nicholas laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an odd experience to be told that I can
be of service to any one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Danver, I want you to release me from my
promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s eyes narrowed suddenly. A little
gleam, like the spark from iron striking flint,
flashed from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked coldly.</p>
<p>Trix&#8217;s heart chilled at the tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must try and explain,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In the
first place, of course you know who your under-gardener
really is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas stared at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask what that has got to do with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know too, you see,&#8221; said Trix, feeling
her heart beginning to beat still more quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know? What questions have you
been asking?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t asked any questions,&#8221; she said
quickly. &#8220;I saw him the day I came here before.
I knew his face then, but I couldn&#8217;t remember who
he was. Afterwards I remembered I used to play
with him when I was a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried Nicholas briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; echoed Trix desperately, &#8220;I want to
be able to tell someone he is Antony Gray, and not
Michael Field. It is really very important that
they should know, important for their happiness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
But if I tell, they may want to know where I saw
him, and ask questions which might lead to my
either having to tell lies or betray your secret. If
it becomes necessary, may I betray your secret?
Will you release me from my promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s hand clenched tightly on the arm
of his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly not,&#8221; he replied shortly.</p>
<p>The tone was utterly final. Trix felt the old
childish fear of him surging over her. It was
quite different from the nervousness she had just
been experiencing, and, oddly enough, it gave her a
kind of desperate courage. She had no intention
of accepting his refusal without a struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t tell unless it became absolutely
necessary,&#8221; she urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;It never can be absolutely necessary,&#8221; he
retorted. &#8220;It would be no more dishonourable to
tell a lie than break a promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix went scarlet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had the smallest intention of doing
either,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;If I had, I need not have
troubled to come up here and ask you to release
me from my promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas drummed his fingers on a small table
near him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve had my answer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His voice was perfectly adamantine. Trix
felt as if she were up against a piece of rock. She
knew it was useless to pursue the subject further,
yet for Pia&#8217;s sake she tried again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Danver, why do you want everyone to
think you&#8217;re dead?&#8221; There was something almost
childish in the way she put the question.</p>
<p>Nicholas laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly, my dear young lady, for my own amusement,
but largely for a scheme I have on hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix leant forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the scheme really important?&#8221; she queried,
her eyes on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he replied, watching her.
&#8220;But my amusement is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amusement,&#8221; said Trix slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my amusement,&#8221; he repeated mockingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had none for fifteen years. For fifteen
years I have lived here like a log, alone, solitary.
Now I&#8217;ve got a little amusement in pretending
to be dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix shook her head. It sounded quite mad.
Then she remembered Doctor Hilary&#8217;s words to
her when she had met him at the gates of Chorley
Old Hall last August. He knew it was mad,
but it was saving Nicholas from being atrophied,
so he had said. To Trix&#8217;s mind at least a dozen
more satisfactory ways might have been found to
accomplish that end. But every man to his own
taste. Also it was quite possible that a brain
which had been atrophied, or practically atrophied
for fifteen years, was not particularly capable
of conceiving anything more enlivening.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you needn&#8217;t have been a log for fifteen
years,&#8221; she said suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t I?&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;Look at me.&#8221;
He made a gesture towards his helpless legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking of your body,&#8221; said Trix
calmly. &#8220;I was thinking of your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s face hardened.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so was I,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;when I preferred
to sit here like a log, rather than face the prying
sympathy of my fellow-humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Trix softly, a light of illumination
breaking in upon her. &#8220;But, Mr. Danver, sympathy
isn&#8217;t always prying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;Prying or not, I didn&#8217;t
want it. Staring eyes, condoling words, and mockery
in their hearts! &#8216;He got what he deserved for
his madness,&#8217; they&#8217;d have said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix leant forward, putting her hands on the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Danver,&#8221; she said thoughtfully, &#8220;if you
were a younger man, or I were an older woman, I&#8217;d
say you were&mdash;well, quite remarkably foolish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas chuckled. He liked this.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might forget our respective ages for a
few moments,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;that is, if you have
anything enlivening to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about it being enlivening,&#8221;
remarked Trix calmly, &#8220;but I have got quite a
good deal to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it then,&#8221; chuckled Nicholas.</p>
<p>Trix drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Danver, did you ever care for any one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s eyes blazed suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil&mdash;&#8221; he began. &#8220;I beg your
pardon. I gave you leave to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trix waved her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was talking about men,&#8221; she said, &#8220;men pals.
Were there any you ever cared about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father, my dear young lady, and Richard
Gray, father of the man who has led to this
interesting discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were really your friends?&#8221; queried Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best fellows that ever stepped,&#8221; said
Nicholas with unwonted enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Trix nodded. Her eyes were shining. She
was thinking of her aunt&#8217;s disclosure regarding
this Richard Gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose,&#8221; she said coolly, &#8220;you rejoiced
when Richard Gray lost his money? You laughed
at him for a fool?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas stared at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth do you mean?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I
never knew he had lost money. I would have
given my right hand to help him if I had known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did lose money,&#8221; said Trix. &#8220;But that&#8217;s
beside the point. You&#8217;d have helped him if you
could? You wouldn&#8217;t have jeered at him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you take me for?&#8221; asked Nicholas
half angrily.</p>
<p>Trix looked very straight at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only what you take others for, Mr. Danver.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Trix suddenly. &#8220;You would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
have been generous to him, because you cared for
him. Do you really think you are the only generous
friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas looked at her. There was a gleam of
laughter in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me you are a very shrewd young
woman,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only logical common sense,&#8221; declared
Trix stoutly.</p>
<p>Once more there fell a silence, a silence in
which Nicholas was watching the girl opposite to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Danver, will you tell me exactly what
amusement you found in all this? What originated
the idea in your mind?&#8221; Her voice was
pleading.</p>
<p>For a moment Nicholas was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said suddenly, &#8220;I will tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a long story, and to Trix it was
oddly pathetic. It was the mixture partly of
regret, partly the desire of justice to be administered
to his property after his death, and partly
the queer mad love of pranks which had been the
keynote of his nature, and which had stirred again
within the half-dead body. He told it all very
simply, baldly almost, and yet he could not quite
hide a certain queer wistfulness underlying it,
the wistfulness of pride which has built barriers
too strong for it, and yet from which it longs to
escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Antony Gray could have a taste of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
living as one of the people,&#8221; he ended. &#8220;Perhaps
it would make him a better master than I had
been. And then the scheme took shape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Trix slowly and thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; queried Nicholas.</p>
<p>Trix looked up at him. Her lips were smiling,
but there were tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps I understand
ever so much better than you think. But&mdash;but
has it been worth it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas looked towards the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the first planning, I don&#8217;t honestly
know that it has,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A thing falls flat
with no one to share it with you. And Hilary
never really approved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was a silence, and again the odd
pathos, the childishness of the whole thing stirred
Trix&#8217;s heart. She said she understood, and she
did understand more profoundly than Nicholas
could possibly have conceived. In the few seconds
of silence which followed, she reviewed those solitary
years in an amazingly quick mental process.
She saw first the pride which had built the barrier,
and then the slow stagnation behind it. She
realized the two sentences which had penetrated
the barrier (he had been perfectly candid in his
story) without being able to destroy it, and then
the faint stirrings of life within the almost stagnant
mind. And the result had been this perfectly
mad scheme,&mdash;the thought of a foolish boy conceived
and carried out by the obstinate mind of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
a man; a scheme childish, foolish, mad, and of
value only in so far as it had roused to faint life
the mind of the lonely man who had conceived it.</p>
<p>And now he had tired of it. It had become to
him as valueless as a flimsy toy; and yet he clung
to it rather than leave himself with empty hands.
Without it, he had absolutely nothing to interest
him,&mdash;a past on which it hurt him to dwell by reason
of its contrast with the present; a present as
lonely almost as that of a prisoner in solitary confinement;
and a future which to him was a mere
blank, a grey nothingness.</p>
<p>Trix shivered involuntarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the fact remains, that I am dead,&#8221; said
Nicholas with a grim smile.</p>
<p>Trix turned suddenly towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you have a sort of resurrection,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>Nicholas stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Trix.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>TRIX TRIUMPHANT</h3>
</div>

<p>It was more than an hour before Trix departed,
exultant, rejoicing.</p>
<p>Nicholas sat staring at the chair she had just
vacated. He had been bewitched, utterly bewitched,
and he knew it. Her vitality, her insistence
had carried him with her despite himself,&mdash;that
and an odd under-current of something he
could not entirely explain. He might have called
it faith, only it was not faith as he had been
accustomed to think of it, when he thought at
all. It was so infinitely more alive and personal.
And yet she had only once touched on what he
would have termed religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve wandered entirely from the object of
your visit,&#8221; he had remarked at one point in the
conversation, &#8220;and I can&#8217;t for the life of me see
why you are taking this extraordinary interest in
what you consider my welfare. What on earth
can it matter to any one else, how I choose to live
my life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but it does matter,&#8221; she had answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
earnestly, &#8220;it matters quite supremely. I know
we often pretend to ourselves that it doesn&#8217;t in the
least matter how we live our lives so long as we
don&#8217;t commit actual sin; but we can&#8217;t isolate ourselves
from others without loss to them and to
ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about monks and nuns, who shut themselves
up, and never see their fellow-creatures at
all?&#8221; he had retorted, greatly pleased with himself
for the retort.</p>
<p>Trix had opened eyes of wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The contemplative orders! Why, Mr. Danver,
they&#8217;re the cog-wheels of the whole machinery.
They only keep their bodies apart that their
minds may be more free. Nobody has the good
of mankind so much at heart as a contemplative.
They are keeping the machinery going by prayer
the whole time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The utter conviction in her words was unmistakable.
For an odd flashing moment he had had
something like a mental vision of an irresistible
force pouring forth from those closed houses, a
force like the force of a great river, carrying all
things with it, and with healing virtue in its waters.
The thought was utterly foreign to him. But it
had been there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not much of a believer in prayer,&#8221; he
had said dryly. He had expected her to ask if he
had ever tried it. She had not done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of us do it so badly,&#8221; she had said
with a little sigh, &#8220;but they don&#8217;t.&#8221; And then she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
had flashed a glance of amusement at him. &#8220;Did
you ever hear of the story of the old lady who said
she was going to pray one night with entire faith
that the hill beyond her garden might be removed?
In the morning she found it still there. &#8216;I knew
it would be!&#8217; said the old lady triumphantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas joined in her laugh, but somewhat
grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all like that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trix shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all, mercifully; but a good many.&#8221; And
then she had returned to her former charge.</p>
<p>Well, she had ended by bewitching him, and
the queer thing was he was quite glad of the
bewitchment. Now and again he pulled himself
up with a jerk and a muttered word or two of irritation;
but it was all a pretence, and he knew it.
There was an odd excitement pulsing at his heart;
despite his age and crippled state, he was feeling
boyishly, absurdly young. For the first time for
fifteen years he was looking forward to the morrow
with pleasure.</p>
<p>He began to consider his programme. It was
entirely simple. First there was Antony Gray to
be interviewed. She had insisted on that. It was
due to him to be given an entire, full, and detailed
account of the whole business, so she had decreed.
Nicholas shrugged his shoulders at the thought.
There was just a question in his mind as to how the
young man might regard the matter. Secondly,
there was to be a tea-party in the library, at which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
Trix, the Duchessa, Miss Tibbutt, Antony, and
Doctor Hilary were to be present. After that&mdash;well,
events might take their own course. The
villagers get to hear? Let them. Any amount of
gossip? Of course, what did he expect? Anyhow
he&#8217;d be a benefactor to mankind in giving
poor, dull little Byestry something more interesting
to talk about than the latest baby&#8217;s first tooth,
or the last injustice of Mr. Curtis. Yes; she meant
it. Mr. Curtis was unjust, and the sooner Mr.
Danver got rid of him and put Antony Gray in his
place the better it would be for everyone concerned.
And if he wanted a really dramatic
moment he had better have Mr. Curtis up, and
inform him that his services were no longer
needed, and introduce him to the new agent at
the same time. Trix only wished she could be
present at the interview, but Mr. Danver would
have to describe it to her in the minutest detail.</p>
<p>It is not at all certain that the thought of
this interview, suggested before Trix had wrung
the final promise from him, did not go a remarkably
long way towards extracting that promise.
The idea appealed to Nicholas. In the first place
there would be the agent&#8217;s profound amazement
at the fact that Nicholas was not lying, as he had
supposed, in the tomb of his ancestors; in the
second place there would be his discomfiture in
realizing that Nicholas had been entirely aware
of his own movements, and the small act of petty
spite towards Job Grantley and Antony; and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
the third place there would be his amazement and
discomfiture combined when he found that Nicholas
was not the doddering old ass he had taken him
for, but a man prepared to take matters into his
own hands, and put a stop once and for all to a
long system of tyranny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir, a man, and not the crippled fool you
have taken me for,&#8221; Nicholas heard himself saying.
He chuckled at the thought.</p>
<p>And then he sat upright. What need to wait
till the morrow for that interview? It was
barely lunch time. A message to Antony requesting
his presence at two o&#8217;clock, another to Mr.
Curtis requesting his an hour later, and the game
could be begun immediately.</p>
<p>Once more Nicholas chuckled. Then he pressed
the electric button attached to the arm of his
chair.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>For once, and once only, in the long course
of his butlership did the placid and unmoved calm
of his manner entirely desert Jessop. The occasion
was the present one.</p>
<p>He was in the pantry cleaning silver, when
the whirr of the electric bell just above his head
broke the silence. He put down the spoon he
was polishing, discarded his green baize apron,
donned his coat, and made his dignified way to the
library.</p>
<p>Nicholas looked up at his entrance.</p>
<p>Accustomed to note every slightest variance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
in his master&#8217;s moods, Jessop was at once aware of
something unusual in his bearing. There was an
odd, suppressed excitement; the nonchalance of his
manner was unquestionably assumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Jessop, I rang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yessir,&#8221; said Jessop, imperturbably, as who
should say, &#8220;Naturally, since I have answered
the summons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;Jessop, you can bring Michael Field here
at two o&#8217;clock this afternoon, when he returns from
his dinner. You can also let Mr. Curtis know that
he is to be here at three o&#8217;clock. You had better
go to Byestry and give the message yourself. If he
wishes to know by whose orders, you need mention
no names, but merely say that orders have
been given you to that effect. I fancy curiosity
will bring him, even if he resents the non-mention
of actual authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessop stared, actually stared, a prolonged,
amazed survey of his master&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are seeing them, sir!&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>For a moment testiness swung to the fore at
the question. Then the amazement on Jessop&#8217;s
face unloosed his sense of humour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nicholas quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; began Jessop. His mind was in a
chaos. The order was so utterly unexpected.
There were at least a million things he wished
to point out, but the only one on which his brain
would focus was the fact that if these men saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
Nicholas, they would no longer imagine him to be
dead. And yet that fact was so obvious, it was
evident it must have occurred to Nicholas&#8217;s own
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to think,&#8221; remarked Nicholas grimly,
&#8220;merely obey orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words pricked, restoring Jessop&#8217;s balance.
He drew himself to rigid attention, the mask
suddenly resumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, sir,&#8221; and Jessop left the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the blue blazes!&#8221; he muttered, as he
returned, almost stumbling, towards the pantry.</p>
<p>The expression had belonged to the youthful
Nicholas. Jessop borrowed it only at moments
of the severest stress. It was borrowed now.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>AN OLD MAN TELLS HIS STORY</h3>
</div>

<p>Antony did not in the least understand Jessop&#8217;s
request to follow him to the library, when he
returned from his midday meal. He imagined
that there was some job which required doing, and
that Jessop was regarding him in the light of a
handy man. Anyhow Antony followed him good-humouredly
enough, and not without a certain
degree of curiosity. The big, silent house had
always exercised an odd fascination over him,
and he had more than once had a strong desire
to set foot within its walls. He experienced an
almost unconscious excitement in complying with
the order.</p>
<p>He followed Jessop up the steps, and through
the big door. Facing him were wide shallow oak
stairs, uncovered and polished. Great Turkish
rugs lay on the hall floor; two huge palms in big
Oriental pots stood at either side of the stairs;
hunting crops and antlers adorned the walls.
Jessop opened a door on the right. Almost before
Antony had realized what was happening, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
butler had withdrawn and closed the door behind
him.</p>
<p>Antony half turned in amazement towards the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a start Antony turned back into the
room. It was not empty, as he had imagined it to
be. A white-haired, black-eyed man was sitting
in a big oak chair, his colourless hands resting on
the arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>Memory surged over Antony in a flood. Alteration
there unquestionably was in the crippled form
before him, but the black piercing eyes were
unchanged. The suddenness of his surprise made
his brain reel. He put out his hand towards the
back of a chair to steady himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you know me, Antony Gray,&#8221; came the
mocking old voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nicholas Danver,&#8221; Antony heard himself
saying, though he hardly realized he was speaking
the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; smiled Nicholas, &#8220;not dead, but
very much alive, though not&mdash;&#8221; he glanced down
at his helpless legs,&mdash;&#8220;precisely what you might
term kicking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony drew a deep breath. What in the
name of wonder did this astounding drama
portend?</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Nicholas shortly, pointing
to a chair. &#8220;I have a good deal to say to you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
You would be tired of standing before I have
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony sat down. The Arabian Nights entertainment
sensation he had formerly experienced
in the offices of Messrs. Parsons and Glieve, rushed
upon him with an even fuller force; yet here the
lighter and almost humorous note was lacking.
Something tinged with resentment had taken its
place. He felt himself to have been trapped,
befooled, though he had not yet fully grasped the
manner of the befooling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a friend of your father,&#8221; said Nicholas
abruptly.</p>
<p>The story would not be told exactly as he had
told it to Trix, though the difference in the telling
would be largely unconscious. It would deal more
with the surface of things, and less with the inner
trend of thought, the telling of which had been
drawn from him by her unspoken sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Antony quietly, in answer to
the remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also I met you once,&#8221; said Nicholas, a little
reminiscent smile dawning in his eyes. It had an
oddly softening effect upon his rather carven face.
For the moment he looked almost youthful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; replied Antony gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; said Nicholas, the smile finding
its way to his lips. &#8220;What a determined youngster
you were! &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to. I&#8217;ve begun!&#8217;&#8221;
Nicholas threw back his head with a laugh. &#8220;It
appealed to me, did that sentiment. I saw the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
bulldog grip in it. But there was no viciousness
in the statement. Jove! you weren&#8217;t even angry.
You were as cool as a cucumber in your mind,
though your cheeks were crimson with the effort.
You succeeded, too. I had forgotten the whole
business till last March. Then it came back to
me. I&#8217;ve got to tell you the story to explain
matters. It is only fair that you should know
the ins and outs of this business. I have no doubt
it seems pretty queer to you?&#8221; Nicholas paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I confess I am somewhat at a loss regarding
it,&#8221; returned Antony dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not over-pleased,&#8221; muttered Nicholas inwardly.
Aloud he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt you will
think it all a sort of fool show, and I am by no
means sure that I don&#8217;t regard it in something that
fashion myself now. However&mdash;&#8221; Nicholas
cleared his throat. &#8220;Since my accident on the
hunting field I have seen no one. I had no desire
to have a lot of gossipping women and old fool men
around. I hate their cackle. I left the management
of the estate to Standing, my agent. When
he left&mdash;he got the offer of a post on Lord Sinclair&#8217;s
estate&mdash;Spencer Curtis took his place.
He had to report to me, and I saw that he kept
things going all right. He was not an easy man to
the tenants, but I did not particularly want a
softling, you understand. Last March one of the
tenants&mdash;Job Grantley, you know him&mdash;sneaked
up here. It had been a vile day. He was in
difficulties as to his rent, and Curtis was putting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
the pressure on. He had a fancy for squeezing
those who couldn&#8217;t retaliate, I suppose. Dirty
hound!&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony made a little sound indicative of entire
assent. He was becoming interested in the recital.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learnt a little more about him,&#8221; went on
Nicholas smiling thoughtfully, &#8220;though he never
guessed I made any enquiries. That was later.
At the moment Job Grantley&#8217;s tale was enough
for me,&mdash;that, and something else he chanced to
say. After he had gone I sat thinking, first of past
days, then of the future. A distant cousin was
heir to the property, a fellow to whom Curtis
would have been a man after his own heart. I&#8217;d
never had what you might precisely term a feeling
of bosom friendship towards William Gateley.
Oddly enough, you came into my mind at the
moment. I remembered the whole scene on the
moorland. I could not get away from the memory.
Then the thought flashed into my mind to
make you my heir. It seemed absurd, but it
remained a fixture, nevertheless. The main thoroughly
reasonable objection was that I knew
exceedingly little about you. The child is not
always father to the man. Fate takes a hand in
the after moulding at times. Yet if it were not
you it would be Gateley. That, at all events, was
my decision. Then I conceived the notion of
making you live as one of the labourers on the
estate, in short of giving you some first-hand knowledge
of a labourer&#8217;s method of living, and incidentally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
of the tenderness of Curtis. Do you follow
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony nodded, an odd smile on his lips. He
remembered his own conjecture, suggested by Mr.
Albert George&#8217;s discourse. The education was
absolutely unnecessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancied,&#8221; went on Nicholas, &#8220;that it might
teach you to be more considerate if you had any
tendencies in an opposite direction. But&mdash;&#8221; he
paused a moment, then smiled grimly,&mdash;&#8220;well,
you may as well have the truth even if it is slightly
unpalatable, and you can remember that I did not
know you as a man. I was not sure of you. If
you had known I was up here, and you had got
an inkling of the game I was playing, what was to
prevent you from playing your own game for
the year, I argued, in fact pretending to a sympathy
with the tenants which you did not feel. I
have never had the highest opinion of human
nature. On that account I conceived the idea
of dying. It was easily carried out. The folk
around were amazingly gullible; the report spread
like wild-fire,&mdash;through the village, that is to say.
I don&#8217;t for a moment suppose it went much beyond
it. The solicitors were in our confidence, and no
obituary notice appeared in the papers. The
villagers were not likely to notice the omission.
Gateley is in Australia. Yes; it was easy enough
to manage. But I see the weakness in the business
now. You might quite well have imagined Hilary
to be the watch-dog, and have played your game to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
him, and if I&#8217;d died suddenly before the year was
up, and you had disclosed your true hand, matters
would not have been as I had intended them
to be. It was a mad idea, I have no doubt, though
on the whole I am not sure that it wasn&#8217;t its very
madness that most appealed to me.&#8221; He stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what,&#8221; said Antony, &#8220;is to be the outcome
of this confidence now?&#8221; There was a certain
stiffness in the question. The odd feeling of resentment
was returning. He suddenly saw the whole
business as a stupid child&#8217;s game, a game in which
he had given his word of honour with no smallest
advantage to any single human being, and with
quite enormous disadvantages to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main outcome,&#8221; said Nicholas, &#8220;is that I
wish to offer you&mdash;Antony Gray&mdash;the post of agent
on my estate for the remainder of my lifetime. At
my death the will I have already drawn up holds
good. The year&#8217;s probation for you therein mentioned
is not likely to be long exceeded, even if it is
exceeded at all. At least such is Doctor Hilary&#8217;s
opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence. Nicholas was watching
Antony from under his shaggy eyebrows. The
man was actually hesitating, debating! What in
the name of wonder did the hesitation mean?
Surely the offer of the post of agent was infinitely
preferable to that of under-gardener? If the latter
had been accepted, why on earth should there be
hesitation regarding the former? So marvelled
Nicholas, having, of course, no clue to the inner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
workings of Antony&#8217;s mind. And even if he had
had, the workings would have appeared to him
illogical and unreasonable. It is truly not fully
certain whether Antony understood them himself.
He only knew that whereas it would be possible,
though difficult, for him to remain in the neighbourhood
of the Duchessa as Michael Field,
gardener, to remain as Antony Gray, gentleman,
appeared to him to be impossible; though precisely
why it should be, he could not well have explained
to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should prefer to decline the offer,&#8221; replied
Antony quietly.</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s face fell. He was blankly disappointed,
as blankly disappointed as a child at the
sudden frustration of some cherished scheme. In
twenty minutes Spencer Curtis, agent, would be
blandly entering the library, and there would
be no <i>coup de théâtre</i>, such as Nicholas had pictured,
to confront him.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask the reason for your refusal?&#8221; questioned
Nicholas, his utter disappointment lending
a flat hardness to his voice.</p>
<p>Antony shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merely that I prefer to refuse,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s mouth set in grim lines. His temper,
never a very equable commodity, got the
better of his diplomacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always possible for me to alter my will,&#8221;
he remarked suavely.</p>
<p>Antony flashed round on him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake alter it, then,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;The most fool thing I ever did in my life was to
fall in with your mad scheme. Write to your
solicitors at once.&#8221; He made for the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; said Nicholas.</p>
<p>Antony halted on the threshold. He was furious
at the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no intention of altering my will,&#8221;
said Nicholas, &#8220;I should like you clearly to understand
that. I intend to abide by my part of the
contract whether you do or do not now see fit to
abide by your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony hesitated. The statement had taken
him somewhat by surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely what I say,&#8221; retorted Nicholas.
&#8220;I have made you my heir, and I have no intention
of revoking that decision. You agreed to work for
me for a year. You can break your contract if
you choose. I shall not break mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can refuse the inheritance,&#8221; said Antony.</p>
<p>Nicholas laughed. &#8220;If you choose to shirk
responsibility and see the tenants remain the
victims of Curtis&#8217;s tenderness, you can do so.
You have had experience of his ideas of fair play,
and let me tell you that your experience has been
of a remarkably mild order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can choose another agent,&#8221; said Antony
shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; said Nicholas, with emphasis on the
first word. &#8220;But I fancy William Gateley will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
find a twin to Curtis on my demise if you refuse
the inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more Antony hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find another heir, then,&#8221; he announced after
a moment.</p>
<p>Nicholas shook his head. &#8220;You hardly encourage
me to do so. My present failure appears so
palpable, I am not very likely to make a second
attempt in that direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was a silence. Antony moved
further back into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You rather force my hand,&#8221; he said coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you accept the inheritance?&#8221; asked
Nicholas eagerly. His eagerness was almost too
blatant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will accept it,&#8221; replied Antony dispassionately,
&#8220;and will see justice done to your tenants.
It will not be incumbent on me to make personal
use of your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas let that pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;And for the present?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Concerning the matter of the contract,&#8221; said
Antony stiffly, &#8220;I would point out to you that I
undertook to work for you for a year as Michael
Field, gardener. Well, I will abide by that contract,
and prolong it if necessary.&#8221; He did not say
till the day of Nicholas&#8217;s death. But Nicholas
understood his meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you consider that I am now treating
you fairly,&#8221; said Antony still stiffly, and after a
slight pause.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>Nicholas bowed his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairly, yes,&#8221; he said in an odd, almost pathetic
voice, &#8220;but hardly&mdash;shall we call it&mdash;as a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony looked suddenly amazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted you to help me to get even with
Curtis,&#8221; he replied regretfully. His tone was
somewhat reminiscent of a rueful schoolboy.</p>
<p>Despite himself Antony smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ordered him to come here at three o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
went on Nicholas, glancing at the clock which
wanted only five minutes of the hour. &#8220;I wanted
to give him his <i>congé</i>, and introduce him to the new
agent at the same moment. He believes firmly in
my demise, by the way, which would certainly
have added zest to the business. And now&mdash;well,
it will be a pretty flat sort of compromise, that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony laughed aloud. For the life of him
he could not help it. And then, as he laughed, he
realized in a sudden flash, almost as Trix had
realized, the odd pathos, the utter loneliness which
could find interest in the mad business he&mdash;Nicholas&mdash;had
invented.</p>
<p>Suddenly Antony spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may as well carry out your original programme,&#8221;
he said, and almost good-humouredly
annoyed at his own swift change of mood.</p>
<p>The library door opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spencer Curtis,&#8221; announced Jessop on a
note of solemn gloom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h3>THE IMPORTANCE OF TRIFLES</h3>
</div>

<p>It was not till a good many hours later that
the anticlimax of the recent situation struck Trix.
Excitement had prevented her from realizing it at
first. In the excitement of what the thing stood
for, she had overlooked the utter triviality of
the thing itself. When, later, the two separated
themselves in a measure, and she looked at the
thing as apart from what it indicated, the ludicrousness
of it struck her with astounding force.</p>
<p>Nicholas Danver would give a tea-party.</p>
<p>And it was this, this small commonplace statement,
which had kept the Duchessa, Miss Tibbutt,
Doctor Hilary, and herself in solemn and amazed
confabulation for at least two hours. It was
infinitely more amazing even than the whole story
of the past months, and Trix had given that in fairly
detailed fashion, avoiding the Duchessa&#8217;s eyes,
however, whenever she mentioned Antony&#8217;s name.
Yes; it was what the tiny fact stood for that
had astounded them; though now, with the fact
in a measure separated from its meaning, Trix
saw the almost absurdity of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>Fifteen years of a living death to terminate
in a tea-party!</p>
<p>It was an anticlimax which made her almost
hysterical to contemplate. She felt that the affair
ought to have wound up in some great movement,
in some dignified action or fine speech, and it had
descended to the merely ludicrous, or what, in view
of those fifteen years, appeared the merely ludicrous.
And she had been the instigator of it, and
Doctor Hilary had called it a miracle. Which it
truly was.</p>
<p>And yet, banishing the ludicrous from her mind,
it was so entirely simple. There was not the
faintest blare of trumpets, not a whisper even of an
announcing voice, merely the fact that a solitary
man would once more welcome friends beneath his
roof.</p>
<p>The only real touch of excitement about the
business would be when Antony Gray learnt the
news, and he and the Duchessa met. And yet
even that somehow lost its significance before the
absorbing yet quiet fact of Nicholas&#8217;s own resurrection.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is looking forward to it like a child,&#8221;
Trix had said.</p>
<p>And Miss Tibbutt had suddenly taken off her
spectacles and wiped them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an odd little thing to feel choky about,&#8221;
she had said with a shaky laugh.</p>
<p>Presently she had left the room. A few moments
later Doctor Hilary had also taken his leave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
Trix and the Duchessa had been left alone. Suddenly
the Duchessa had looked across at Trix.</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you do it?&#8221; she had asked.</p>
<p>Trix understood the question, and the colour
had rushed to her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you do it?&#8221; the Duchessa had
repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;For you,&#8221; Trix had replied in a very small
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guessed?&#8221; the Duchessa had asked
quietly.</p>
<p>Trix nodded. It <i>had</i> been largely guesswork.
There was no need, at the moment at all events,
to speak of Miss Tibbutt&#8217;s share in the matter.
That was for Tibby herself to do if she wished.</p>
<p>The Duchessa had got up from her chair. She
had gone quietly over to Trix and kissed her.
Then she, too, had left the room.</p>
<p>Trix stared thoughtfully into the fire. Its
light was playing on the silver-backed brushes on
her dressing-table, gleaming on the edges of gilt
frames, and throwing her shadow big and dancing
on the wall behind her. The curtains were undrawn,
and without the trees stood ghostly and
bare against the pale grey sky. There was the
dead silence in the atmosphere which tells of frost.</p>
<p>It was just that,&mdash;the oddness of little things,
and their immense importance in life, and simply
because of the influence they have on the human
soul. It was this that made the fact of Nicholas
Danver giving a tea-party of such extraordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
importance, though, viewed apart from its meaning,
it was the most trivial and commonplace thing
in the world.</p>
<p>Trix got up from her chair, and went over to
the window.</p>
<p>Not a twig of the bare trees was stirring. The
earth lay quiet in the grip of the frost king; a
faint pink light still lingered in the western sky.
She looked at the rustic seat and the table beneath
the lime trees. How amazingly long ago the day
seemed when she had sat there with Pia, and heard
the little tale of wounded pride. How amazingly
long ago that very morning seemed, when she had
seen the sunlight flood her window-pane with ruby
jewels. Even her interview with Father Dormer
seemed to belong to another life. It had been
another Trix, and not she herself who had propounded
her difficulty to him, a difficulty so astoundingly
simple of solution.</p>
<p>She heaved a little sigh of intense satisfaction,
and then she caught sight of a figure crossing
the grass.</p>
<p>The Duchessa had come out of the house and
was going towards the garden gate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<h3>A FOOTSTEP ON THE PATH</h3>
</div>

<p>Antony was sitting in his cottage. It was
quite dusk in the little room, but he had not
troubled to light the lamp. A mood of utter
depression was upon him, though for the life of
him he could not tell fully what was causing it.
That very fact increased the depression. There
was nothing definite he could get a grip on, and
combat. He was in no worse situation than he
had been in three hours previously, in fact it
might be considered that he was in an infinitely
better one, and yet this mood was less than three
hours old.</p>
<p>Of course the thought of the Duchessa was at
the root of the depression. But why? If he met
her again&mdash;and all things now considered, the
meeting was even more than probable&mdash;what
earthly difference would it make whether he met
her in his rôle of Michael Field, gardener, or as
Antony Gray, agent? And yet he knew that
it would make a difference. Between the Duchessa
di Donatello and Michael Field there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
fixed a great social gulf. He himself had assured
her of that fact. Keeping that fact in view, he
could deceive himself into the belief that it alone
would be accountable for the aloofness of her
bearing, for the frigidity of her manner should
they again meet. Oh, he&#8217;d pictured the meetings
often enough; pictured, too, and schooled himself
to endure, the aloofness, the frigidity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rubbed it well in that I am only a gardener,
a mere labourer,&#8221; he would assure his soul, with
these imaginary meetings in mind. Of course he
had known perfectly well that he was deceiving
himself, yet even that knowledge had been better
than facing the pain of truth.</p>
<p>But now the truth had got to be faced.</p>
<p>There would be the aloofness, sure enough,
but there would no longer be that great social
gulf to account for it. The true cause would
have to be acknowledged. She scorned him,
firstly on account of his fraud, and secondly because
he had wounded her pride by his quiet
deliberate snubbing of her friendship. Whatever
justification she might presently see for the first
offence, it never for an instant occurred to his
mind that she might overlook the second. He
had deliberately put a barrier between them,
and it appeared to him now, as it had appeared
at the moment of its placing, utterly and entirely
unsurmountable. She would be civil, of course;
there would not be the slightest chances of her forgetting
her manners, but&mdash;his mind swung to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
little hotel courtyard, to the orange trees in green
tubs, to the golden sunshine and the sparkle of the
blue water, to the woman then sitting by his side.</p>
<p>Memory can become a sheer physical pain at
times.</p>
<p>Antony got up from the settle, and moved to
the window. Despite the dusk within the room,
there was still a faint reflection of the sunset in the
sky, a soft pink glow.</p>
<p>One thing was certain&mdash;nothing, no power on
earth, should ever drag him back to Teneriffe
again. If only he could control the action of his
memory as easily as he could control the actions of
his body. At all events he&#8217;d make a fight for it.
And yet, if only&mdash;The phrase summed up every
atom of regret for his mad decision, his falling in
with that idiotic plan of Nicholas&#8217;s. And, after
all, had it been so idiotic? Mad, certainly; but
wasn&#8217;t there a certain justification in the madness?
It was a madness the villagers would unquestionably
bless.</p>
<p>His thoughts turned to the recent interview.
It had fully borne out all Nicholas&#8217;s expectations.
Bland, self-confident, Curtis had entered the library.
Antony had had no faintest notion whom
he had expected to see therein, but most assuredly
it was not the two figures who had confronted him.
Bewilderment had passed over his face, and an odd
undernote of fear. It was just possible he had
taken Nicholas for a ghost. The reassurance on
that point had set him fairly at his ease. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
had been subservient to Nicholas, extravagantly
amused to learn of the trick that had been played.
He had been insolently oblivious of Antony&#8217;s
presence. Antony had enjoyed the insolence.
When he learnt that his services were no longer
required, he had first appeared slightly discomfited.
Then he had plucked up heart of grace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to take matters into your own hands?&#8221;
he had said to Nicholas. &#8220;Excellent, my dear
sir, excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicholas had glanced down at the said hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he had said slowly, &#8220;that they are
rather old. No; I have other plans in view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Curtis had queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to try a new <i>régime</i>,&#8221; Nicholas had
said calmly. &#8220;I should like to introduce you to
my new agent.&#8221; He had waved his hand towards
Antony.</p>
<p>Black as murder is a well-worn and somewhat
trite expression, nevertheless it alone adequately
described the old agent&#8217;s expression. And then,
with a palpable effort, he had recovered himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;A really excellent plan,&#8221; he had said, with
scarcely veiled insolence. &#8220;I congratulate you on
your new <i>régime</i>. They say &#8216;Set a thief to catch a
thief&#8217;; no doubt &#8216;Set a hind to rule a hind&#8217; will
prove equally efficacious.&#8221; He had laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; Nicholas&#8217;s voice, suave
and calm, had broken in upon the laugh, &#8220;that is
the very <i>régime</i> I am now abolishing. &#8216;Set a
gentleman to rule a hind&#8217; is the one I am about to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
establish, that is why I have offered the post of
agent to Mr. Antony Gray, son of a very old friend
of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>For one brief instant Curtis had been entirely
non-plussed, the cut in the speech was lost in
amazement; then bluster had come to his rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have had recourse to a system of spying,&#8221;
he had said with a sneer that certainly did
not in the least disguise his fury. &#8220;Personally I
have never looked upon it as a gentleman&#8217;s profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The question of a gentleman&#8217;s profession
is not one in which I should readily take your
advice, Mr. Curtis,&#8221; Nicholas had replied, smiling
gently.</p>
<p>Curtis had turned to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not come here to be insulted,&#8221; he had
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; Nicholas had retorted sternly,
&#8220;have I paid you to insult my tenants. You have
accused me of a system of spying. You yourself
best know whether such a system was justified by
the need. Though I can assure you that Mr. Gray
was no spy. He believed in my death as fully as
you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been some further conversation,&mdash;remarks
it might better be termed. The upshot
had been that Curtis was leaving Byestry of his
own accord on the morrow; Antony took over his
new post immediately.</p>
<p>It had not been till Curtis had left that Nicholas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
had broached the subject of the tea-party the
following day, and had requested Antony&#8217;s presence.
The request had been firmly declined, nor
could all Nicholas&#8217;s persuasions move Antony from
his resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am utterly unsociable,&#8221; Antony had declared.</p>
<p>Nicholas smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I, or, at any rate, so I was till Miss
Devereux took me in hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Devereux!&#8221; Antony had echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s at the bottom of this business,&#8221;
Nicholas had assured him, &#8220;though what further
plot she has up her sleeve I don&#8217;t know. Why, if it
hadn&#8217;t been&mdash;&#8221; And then, on the very verge of
declaring that Antony himself had been the real
foundation of the whole business, he had stopped
short. Never in his life had Nicholas betrayed
a lady&#8217;s secret or what might have been a lady&#8217;s
secret. They were pretty much one and the same
thing as far as his silence on the matter was
concerned.</p>
<p>Well, the long and the short of the whole business
was that the tenants of the Chorley Estate
were about to receive fair play, and Nicholas was
about to emerge from the chrysalis-like existence
in which he had shrouded himself for fifteen years,&mdash;an
advantage, certainly, in both instances.
Only so far as Antony&#8217;s own self was concerned
there didn&#8217;t seem the least atom of an advantage
anywhere. Of course he was fully aware that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
he ought to see immense advantages. But he
didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to have loved and lost than never
to have loved at all,&#8221; says one of the poets. Was
it Tennyson? But then that depends very largely
on the manner of the losing. And in this case!</p>
<p>Antony crossed to the dresser and lighted the
small lamp. He had just set it in the middle of
the table when he heard the click of his garden
gate, and a footstep on his little flagged path.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<h3>ON THE OLD FOUNDATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Antony stood very still by the table. Once
before he had heard that same footfall on his path,&mdash;a
light resolute step. His face had gone quite
white beneath its tan. There was a knock on the
door. For one brief second he paused. Then he
crossed the room, and opened the door wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come in?&#8221; asked the Duchessa.</p>
<p>He moved aside, and she came into the room,
standing in the lamplight. He stood near her,
words, conventional words, driven from his lips by
the mad pounding and beating of his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I sit down?&#8221; asked the Duchessa a
little breathlessly. And she crossed to the settle.
Her face was in shadow here, but Antony had seen
that it was strangely white.</p>
<p>Still Antony had not spoken.</p>
<p>The Duchessa looked up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am nervous,&#8221; said she, an odd little tremor
in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nervous!&#8221; echoed Antony, surprise lending
speech to his tongue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nervous,&#8221; she replied, the odd little tremor
still in her voice. &#8220;I owe you an apology, oh, the
very deepest apology, and I don&#8217;t know how to
begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t begin at all,&#8221; said Antony hoarsely,
sternly almost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but I must. Think how I spoke to you.
You&mdash;we had agreed that trust was the very
foundation of friendship, and I destroyed the
foundation at the outset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not likely you could understand,&#8221;
said Antony.</p>
<p>She caught her breath, a little quick intake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you say the same if it had been the
other way about? Would <i>you</i> have destroyed the
foundation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I hope not,&#8221; he stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you appear to think it reasonable
that I should have done so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not quite understand the tone of
her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it reasonable you did not understand,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;How could you? Nobody could
have understood. It was the maddest, the most
inconceivable situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly. Yet if the positions had been
reversed, if it had been you who had failed to
understand my actions, would you not still have
trusted?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Antony, conviction in the syllable.
He did not think to ask her how it was that she
understood now. The simple fact that she did
understand swept aside, made trivial every other
consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that a man&#8217;s trust holds good under
any circumstances, whereas a woman&#8217;s trust will
obviously fail before the first difficulty?&#8221; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not mean that,&#8221; cried Antony hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; she queried mockingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not, on my part, a question of <i>trust</i>
alone,&#8221; said Antony deliberately. He looked
straight at her as he spoke the words.</p>
<p>The Duchessa dropped her eyes. A crimson
colour tinged her cheeks, crept upwards to her
forehead.</p>
<p>There was a dead silence. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you help me to re-build the foundation?&#8221;
asked the Duchessa.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was never destroyed,&#8221; said Antony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine was,&#8221; she replied steadily. &#8220;Will you
forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There can be no question of forgiveness,&#8221; he
replied hoarsely.</p>
<p>Her face went to white.</p>
<p>&#8220;You refuse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to forgive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Again she drew a quick breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; he replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></p>
<p>The Duchessa looked towards the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he replied slowly, &#8220;between you
and me there can be no question of forgiveness.
To forgive, one must acknowledge a wrong done
to one. I acknowledge none.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cared so little, you felt none?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; responded Antony, the words leaping to
his lips, &#8220;I cared so much I felt none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she breathed, and stopped. &#8220;Then you
will go back to the old footing?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Antony&#8217;s heart beat furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she demanded, speaking very low.</p>
<p>Antony drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I love you,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Again there was a dead silence. At last Antony
spoke quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I have no right to tell you that,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;But you may as well know the whole
truth now. It was because of that love that I
agreed to this business. I had nothing to offer you.
Here was my chance to obtain something. I had
no notion then that you lived in this neighbourhood.
When I found out, I was tempted to let
you infer that there was a mystery, some possible
explanation of my conduct. It would have been
breaking my contract in the spirit, though not
actually in the letter. Well, I didn&#8217;t break it
at all, and of course you did not understand. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
order to keep my contract I had to deceive you, or
at all events to allow you to believe an untruth.
Naturally you scorned my deceit, as it appeared
to you. It was that that mattered of course, not
the social position. I understood that completely.
Later, you offered me your friendship. You were
ready to trust without understanding. I could
not accept your trust. A friendship between us
must have led others to suspect that I was not what
I appeared to be. That was to be avoided. It
had to be avoided. I hurt you then, knowing what
I did.&#8221; He stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you hurt yourself too,&#8221; she suggested
quietly.</p>
<p>The muscles in Antony&#8217;s throat contracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; said the Duchessa.</p>
<p>Antony crossed to the hearth. He stood
looking down at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kneel down,&#8221; said the Duchessa.</p>
<p>Obediently he knelt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so blind,&#8221; said the Duchessa pathetically,
&#8220;that you need to look very close to see
things clearly. Look right into my eyes. Can&#8217;t
you see something there that will heal that hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>A great sob broke from Antony&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, don&#8217;t, dear heart, don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried the
Duchessa, drawing his head against her breast.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Will the new agent agree to live at the Manor
House?&#8221; asked the Duchessa, after a long, long

few words. &#8220;Will his pride allow him to accept a
small material benefit for a short time, seeing
what a great amount of material benefit will be his
to bestow in the future?&#8221;</p>
<p>Antony laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told Mr. Danver I wouldn&#8217;t use a penny of
his money for myself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She raised her eyebrows in half comical
dismay, which hid, however, a hint of real anxiety.
Would his pride accept where it did not bestow
in like kind? For other reason than this the
bestowal would signify not at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mind?&#8221; he asked smiling.</p>
<p>She looked straight at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the smallest atom,&#8221; she declared, utterly
relieved, since there was no shadow of false pride
in the laughing eyes which met her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but,&#8221; said Antony slowly, and very, very
deliberately, &#8220;I never said I would not use it for
my wife.&#8221;</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p>An old man was sitting in the library of the
big grey house. A shaded reading-lamp stood on a
small table near his elbow. Its light was thrown
on an open book lying near it, and on the carved
arms of the oak chair in which the man was sitting.
It shone clearly on his bloodless old hands, on his
parchment-like face and white hair. A log fire
was burning in a great open hearth on his right.
For the rest, the room was a place of shadows,
deepening to gloom in the distant corners, a gloom
emphasized by the one small circle of brilliant
light, and the red glow of the fire. Book-cases
reached from floor to ceiling the whole length of two
walls, and between the thickly curtained windows
of the third. In the fourth wall was the fireplace
and the door.</p>
<p>There was no sound to break the silence. The
figure in the oak chair sat motionless. He might
have been carved out of stone, for any sign of life
he gave. He looked like stone,&mdash;white and black
marble very finely sculptured,&mdash;white marble in
head and hands, black marble in the piercing eyes,
the long satin dressing-gown, the oak of the big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
chair. Even his eyes seemed stone-like, motionless,
and fixed thoughtfully on space.</p>
<p>The big room was very still. An hour ago it
had been full of voices and laughter, amazed
questions, and half-mocking explanations.</p>
<p>Later the front door had banged. There had
been the sound of steps on the frosty drive, receding
in the distance. Then silence.</p>
<p>Nicholas&#8217;s eyes turned towards the middle
window of the three, surveying the heavy hanging
curtain.</p>
<p>A whimsical smile lighted up his grim old mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, it wasn&#8217;t a wasted year,&#8221; he said
aloud.</p>
<p>Then he turned and looked round the empty
room. It seemed curiously deserted now.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the year is not yet ended,&#8221; he added. He
was amazed at the pleasure the thought gave him.</p>
